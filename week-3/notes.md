### Muhammad at Mecca

#### The birth of Muhammad
To start with Muhammad at Mecca, we must look at Muhammad's birth
There are many similarities between Muhammad's birth and Jesus' birth
The important thing to remember in Muhammad's birth is that it gives him a connection to Abraham
There are always miracles around the births of major characters (Moses, Jesus, etc)
First, the account is located around the Ka'Ba in Mecca (though in previous notes, it was noted that Mecca may have been located somewhere else
The Christian king of Ethiopia (Abraha) is jealous of the Ka'ba and so he builds a cathedral and orders people to use it
Someone desecrated this cathedral that he built (purposely to offend Abraha for making them go to the cathedral instead)
Abraha decides to send an army to destroy the Ka'ba
- It's interesting to note that this is apparently before Muhammad gets rid of the idols in the Ka'ba
- The Ka'ba is still apparently important to Arabs in a "good" way
Abraha rides an elephant to go to battle and was unknown to Arabs previously
upon hearing of the impending attack, Muhammad's tribe (the Quraysh) rallied to battle Abraha
Abraha did not want to fight them, he only wanted to wreck the Ka'ba
Muhammad's grandfather intercedes for the city and only asks for his camels back, stating that the Ka'ba is protected by Allah and doesn't need his intercesion
- This is a reference to Allah BEFORE Muhammad is born
- This is to establish the legitimacy of Muhammad's line
Muhammad's grandfather sends the rest of the town away, and he holds on to the door of the Ka'ba to pray and "protect" (unnecessary because of Allah) the Ka'ba
When the elephant arrives at the city, he will not approach the Ka'ba
- Whenever the elephant is faced towards Mecca/The Ka'ba, he sits/lays down
- whenever the elephant is faced away from Mecca/the Ka'ba, he starts walking again
The elephant must be left behind (apparently)
Allah then sends an army of small birds (Ababil) who each have three rocks
The birds drop the rocks en masse and destroy the army
Abraha is seriously wounded and ultimately dies on the way back to Yemen
This account establishes that Allah is at work and is preparing the way (the family even) for the future prophet Muhammad
Q 105 lays out this story in a sort of vague way, and is ultimately clarified by the Serah years later
This account is purported to happen the same year as Muhammad's birth (570 AD)

#### Critical thoughts
- Would an Ethiopian King really bring an elephant through the desert to attack Mecca?
- Daniel A. Beck writes "Maccabees not Mecca: The Biblical Subtext of Surat Al-Fil."
- This book argues that Q 105 is much better understood as an Arabic homiletic on the narratives of 2 & 3 Maccabees, which were flourishing in this area at this time
- Elephants also show up in 2/3 Maccabees and involves polytheists attacking believers

#### Muhammad's career in Mecca
He began his ministry at the age of 40 with Gabriel's call
He began receiving revelations in month of Ramadan of 611
He was first concerned with Jinn
Khadija assured him and Waraqa ibn Nawfal (a Christian) confirmed his prophetic career
his mother prophecies he will be a prophet when he is 5 (Halima)
A Syrian Arab monk prophecies he is a prophet (Bahira)

We are already starting to see that there is a bit of lore/history around Allah even before Muhammad is born
Was Muhammad a monotheist right away?


## Lecture 10

### History of Allah
We know very little about Allah in pre-Islam
Muhammad's grandfather apparently spoke about Allah, but that could have been a flourish from a later writer to emphasize Muhammad's family line
Muhammad's father (Abdullah) has a name which means "servant of Allah"
We know that "Allah" as a term was neither unknown nor uninmportant because it is a generic term for "god" or "elohim"
We can be sure that Allah was one of the 360 idols worshipped by the pagans
We can also be sure that Allah had what the Qur'an calls (not nicely) "associates" or other gods and goddesses who shared his cult/shrine
In pre-Islamic Arabia, the creator god was called "Allah", which simply meant "the god"
Allah was elevated until reaching a position of highest emmanence which ultimately meant people sought lower or less powerful deities to consult on their behalf before Allah
The three "big" goddesses in the area (Al-Uzza, Al-Lat, and Menat) were called the "daughters of Allah"

### The Satanic Verses
At one point in Muhammad's ministry he asks these three goddesses to intercede before Allah on his behalf because he was exhausted from persecution
He wished so much that he could have peace with the polytheists and was daydreaing about it
Gabriel began to recite Qur'anic verses to Muhammad, and Satan slipped in and began giving false verses to Muhammad
Muhammad is then tricked into worshipping these other goddesses
Essentially for a time Muhammad is not a monotheist
Eventually Gabriel eventually is sent to correct Muhammad
Later Islamic scholars would be embarassed by this situation and begin writing it out of history as untrue
Q 53:19-20 accounts for this situation in some ways
Somewhere in here is where the Satanic verses would have been before being removed
These compromising verses made for peaceful relations between Muslims and polytheists for a time
It is at this time that Abrogation is established to erata these false verses which were not actually supposed to be part of the Qur'an per Gabriel
It is interesting that Allah and Gabriel allowed for this to happen, and to let Muhammad proclaim false gods for any amount of time
Immigrants from far away began to hear about Muhammad's teaching and rejoiced to finally be able to have peace with their polytheistic neighbors

### The Night Journey
This situation set up the stage for Muhammad's miracle
Muhammad flies from Mecca to Jerusalem in one night
- This established Jerusalem as Islamic
- Muhammad visits heaven as well from there
The Qur'an says that Muhammad does not perform miracles, so this event is likely invented by later authors to emphasize Muhammad's greatness as well as abolish the embarassment of the Satanic verses
You could also argue instead that this miracle happens TO Muhammad, and is not performed by him
He travels from the Great Mosque in Mecca (unknown) to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem
The horse creature waits for him at "the Buraq" (the creatures name) which is known today by Jews as "the wailing wall"
This account is also described as both physical AND spiritual (somehow)
This account is mostly found in Hadith
Q 17:1 could potentially be a reference to this event, but it seems more likely that the Hadith with this tradition were written to explain this passage in the Qur'an
This all takes place just about a year before Muhammad emigrated to Medina
Muhammad climbs a ladder into heaven (see Jacob's ladder in the Bible) where he met many famous figures such as Abraham, Moses, Jesus, etc, and led them in prayer
Essentially Muhammad leads all previous prophets in prayer, which sets him as the final prophet
Islamic sources reference Jerusalem quite regularly, Ibn Ishaq is the earliest biographer of Muhammad (570-632) and supported by many hadiths
Muhammad meets Allah by himself and is told to command Muslims to pray 50 times a day
Moses tells Muhammad to go back and ask for fewer prayers (9 times)
Eventually the prayers are shrunk to 5 prayers a day (see the connection to Abraham petitioning for Sodom and Gomorrah)
This event actually caused many to leave Islam because they thought Muhammad was a liar
This enflames the situation and leads to him needing to move to Medina, because he is not entirely successful in evangelizing Mecca
It is argued even today about whether this journey was physical or mystical
This is the Hijra when Muhammad emigrates to Medina
This designates "year 1" for Muslims
This also begins the period of Muhammad's raids to recapture Mecca

## Lecture 11

### Episodes in Islamic History

#### Hijra / The Immigration (from Mecca to Medina)
This event is a very important event in Islam because it provides us with a delimiter in Muslim history, a point of pivot
Muhammad and Muslims will become very strong while they are in Medina
Mecca was a period of preparation
Medina is a period of elevation and strength and advancement of the Muslim community
This constitutes "year 1" in Islam which is why you will usually see two dates in Islamic scholarship
Muslim tried first to immigrate to Ta'if, but was rejected
After the satanic verses incident, some of Muhammad's followers emmigrate to Ethiopia and didn't want to come back
Some of his uncles lived in Medina
Muhammad acted as an arbiter or a statesman while he was there, learning and developing these skills
Three main groups in Medina: Proponents (Muslims), Emigrants, and Hypocrites (Jewish)
Medina was previously called Yathrib

#### Muhammad at Medina
The constitution of Medina, one of the most significant document that has survived from the time of Muhammad
There is actually not enough evidence to prove that this constitution was __actually__ written in the time of Muhammad
It deals with religious tolerance and tribal conflicts
It created a new Umma (community) shortly after his arrival in Medina
Aus and Khazraj were still pagan but were rapidly becoming Muslims
The three Jewish tribes were included in this treaty/constitution (Banu Qainuqa, Banu Nadhir, Banu Quraidha)
We only have Muslim sources that tell us about this constitution, no outside sources
goals of the constitution:
- Outline rights and duties of groups
- how Muslim community interacts with others on the basis of religion
- does not recognize Christians, only Jews
- Jews were mostly allied with Muslims
- Sets up the ideal model for an Islamic state
Only in Muhammad's biography and Ubayd's Book of State Finance, which are Muslim sources
There are theories that this is several treaties written at several different times and compiled at a later time
History following the establishment of the constitution suggests that this constitution did not do very much for any kind of religious freedom
Even today, Christians are not and cannot be equal with Muslims in Islamic countries and cultures
according to Muslim histories, one year after the constitution was enacted, Muhammad approached one of the Jewish tribes and demanded they convert to Islam -- they refused
Muhammad then ordered a siege of that tribe, and systematically took care of the other tribes as well in the years to come
