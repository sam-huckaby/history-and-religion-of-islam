# History and Religion of Islam
These are the notes from my semester taking a class on the History and Religion of Islam.

## Disclaimers
**Unless otherwise noted, everything contained in these notes is my own interpretation of the lectures.** I may at time misunderstand or misrepresent the material, and I will do everything in my power to correct any obvious erors. That being said, the positions I present in these notes are my own and I accept full responsibility for anything posted herein.

## Goals
The purpose of this class is to learn about the development of Islam during the life of Muhammad through the present day.
My desire with publishing these notes is to present a thoughtful and reasoned approach to learning about Islam without being antagonistic.
While we can and should approach the topic of any religion with a critical eye, this does not mean that we should approach members of other faiths as our enemies.

As a Christian, I believe that we are all created in God's image, and all suffer from the same sinful condition, which means that I am in no better a position than my Muslim neighbor.
While I do not agree with the tenants of Islam as a whole, I do find it quite commendable how hard they work to both love and serve Allah (which is the Arabic word for "God", not a proper name, technically, though it is often used in such a manner because the only definitely correct version of the Qur'an is written in Arabic.

If you find yourself in this repo, my hope is that you are encouraged in your faith, and that you find I have represented Islam in a fair manner.

God bless and مع السلامة
