## Lecture 14

### The motivations behind raids and conquests (religious, or something else?)

- There has been a suggestion that raids and conquests from Muhammad are entirely defensive
- on July 29, 2012, Sheikh 'Ali Jum'a said that the great conquests were a significant factor in the spread of Islam with its tolerance and justice throughout the world
- Conquests associated with spreading shared values

- Yusuuf al-Qaradawi suggested that conquests were to:
- - supress the tyrant authorities of the Byzantines and Persions, which were standing in the way of people accepting Islam
- - Functioned as preventative wars
- - To liberate oppressed and vulnerable people in the conquered lands
- No mention of dominion or economic gain as motivating reasons
- Abbas Mahmud al-'Aqqad in his apologetic explanation of jihad says that conquests were launded to
- - spread "the ethics of the Islamic tennets, aiming at offering justice, tolerance, and protecting the poor"
- Ahmad al-Sharif argues that the raids of Muhammad were to proclaim the Islamic call
- Classical Muslims approached the topic from the same standpoint
- Abu al-Rabi' al-Kala'I said that through these battles Allah empowered or stengthened the faith of/and the believers
- Ibn Taymiyya said that:
- - Muhammad and Islam were sent ALSO to the people of the Book, and so they were meant to call "the Jews and Christians to believe in him [Muhammad]."
- - Allah revealed the Verse of the Sword to affirm striving against the polytheists and the People of the Book
- Therefore we can see that Ibn Taymiyya appears to connect military raids to religious motivations as well
- The above shows that religious motivation is the interpretation of raids was used throughout the history of Islam
- All of these views seek to legitimize raids and conquests by portraying them as apologetic in nature
- Sayyid Abu al-A 'la Mawdudi contrasted secular wars and Muslim military activities, and says that Muslim fighting had nothing to do with "sword and fighting" except for self-defence
- He argues that Muslims conquests were "for Allah's sake or in Allah's path" while other wars are for "despicable lust, wicked desires, and reprehensible ambitions" of the commanders
- Muhammad Abdel Haleem points out that the Qur'anic term jihad is often misunderstood by non-Muslims, and says that "jihad" has nothing military about it
- Abdel Haleem states that "the Qur'an simply reassured the Muslims that they could defend themselves when attacked."
- Safi al-Rehman al-Mubarakpuri argued that Muslim raids were for the Muslims to gain freedom to live peacefully and spread Islam without restrictions"
- - This is troubling, because they were in fact free during these periods and people were seeking (see Battle of Badr lead-up) to avoid conflict with them
- - He argues that war is a way of bringing victory to the oppressed and supression to the oppressor"
- - He argues that it was to free people from worshipping 'al-ibad (created beings)
- Taha Hussain states that Abu Bakr's raids were a continuation of what Muhammad had already begun, and that they were to defend the Muslim territory (though history does not seem to agree)
- Many Muslim scholars do not adopt this religious washing of the raids and conquests
- Sayyid Mahmud al-Qimany demonstrates the political expansion of the early Muslim umma as "a call for a national unity under the leadership of a prophet, who is the founder of one central state."
- - He portrays Muhammad as a clever leader and a skillful warrior
- 'Abdul-Karim, like al-Qimany, portrays the Muslim conquests as invasions that sought the money and posessions of the conquered lands, which resulted in the umma's enrichment while the conquered people starved
- He states that the conquering armies "killed men even after they gave in, captured women and maids, burned castles and destroyed the remnants, plundering possessions of all kinds, forcing taxes on conquered people, and such."
- The phrase "religious motivation" for the raids and conquests refers to the traditional hypothetical claim about Muslim military activity and how it was all in self-defence
- this phrase/idea clearly adopts an apologetic stance for reading and interpreting the military history of Islam


## Lecture 15

### The Battle of Uhud (Muhammad at Medina cont)

- The Battle of Uhud was the second major battle that was commissioned by Muhammad
- The Battle of Uhud took place one year after the Battle of Badr
- Abu Sufyan determined this was the time for the two sides to clash again
- Seven days after Badr, Muhammad led the raid against the sons of Salim which resulted in another victory
- Then Abu Sufyan led a raid against the Muslims in al-Sawiq
- Additional small raids then took place: Ghaswat Dhi Amr and Bahran (not as important to know)
- The Battle of uhud took place as a culmination of these many smaller earlier raids
- We do not have a lot of verifiable historical information, because the majority of information comes from Muslim writers that have a particular slant or bias (like all historians)
- Muslim army initially had 1,000 men, but about 300 left to follow someone else because they didn't believe this battle would go well
- The Meccans had 3,000 men AND Khalid Ibn al-Walid (remember this name for later)
- The Meccans (according to Muslim sources) brought women to the battle to "rouse the warriors" (not sure what that means)
- Muslims were not in consensus about participating in the battle, and Muhammad actually received a divine vision telling him not to leave Medina to go to Uhud (though he still did)
- Initially the Muslims gained a quick victory and an early lead
- However, when the battle was almost won by the Muslims, some of the Muslim archers left their positions against Muhammad's orders to try and gain some of the spoils of war
- Because of this, many Muslims were killed and Muhammad was severely injured
- Muslims then technically lost the battle, but according to Muslim historians, it's still a victory BECAUSE it started as a victory which was all Allah promised
#### Critical Analysis
- Muhammad's divine guidance is tenuous because he had a hesitation to go
- Muslims as a whole could not decide if they should go to war or not
- Even though Muhammad allegedly received a divine vision stating they would slay their enemies (but there is no mention of Gabriel this time like normal...)
- The Muslims who decided not to go to the battle were the 300 mentioned earlier
- The man leading the ones who left (Abdullah ibn Ubayy) seemed more skillful and competant than Muhammad in this version
- The idea that initial victory being equated with "true victory" and then the downfall later being of no consequence is difficult to believe with the rest of Islamic thought and scholarship
- The argument that people leaving was the problem is difficult because initially Muhammad wanted to join those people!
- A more persuasive reason for the loss is that the Meccans were simply much better prepared and their leader was more skillful in choosing his time for battle and preparing his soldiers
- Going back to the archers, why was there such a great desire to leave their position? Because they wanted and probably needed the spoils of war
- There is no arguement to be made that they were looking to proclaim Islam at another spot in the battlefield
- Why not wait until the battle was over?
- It seems that they (the archers) were not as confident that the spoils were going to be dealt out fairly (they had "loot lust")
#### Preparation for the Conquest of Mecca
- This is called "The conquest of the Conquests"
- This brings us back to the matter of the Jews
- Muhammad needed to now break with the Jewish tribes of Medina
- These tribes:
- - Qaynuqa'
- - al-Nadir
- - Qurayza
- And two Jewish Settlements near Medina
- - Khaybar
- - Fadak
- Bringing these tribes under his control will solidify his control over Medina and the surrounding areas
- This would bring the break with the prayer direction as well, as Allah would now change the Qibla to be towards Mecca instead of Jerusalem (around the battle of Badr)


## Lecture 16

### Breaking with the Jews

#### (Banu) Qaynuqa
- Before Uhud, Muhammad needed to take care of some of the Jews around Medina
- Qaynuqa was reportedly (according to legend) the first to break their covenant with Muhammad
- In response, Muhammad met them in their market and called them to Islam or suffer a fate worse than the Meccans in Badr
- Qaynuqa refused, and said they were better fighters than the Meccans
- Calling them to Islam then, was not the same as it is today. This is Muhammad calling them to submit to his leadership and become part of his community and affirm that Muhammad is a true prophet
- Legend has it that a Jewish man lifted up an Arab woman's dress (insulting her) and so a Muslim man killed that Jewish man for insulting that Arab woman 
- This sequence of events led to Muhammad ordering a raid of the tribe
- But the problem is that the first murder in the sequence was a Muslim man murdering a Jewish man
- The woman in the story is also only identified as an "Arab" not a "Muslim"
- No family ties or a chain of transmission is present, which makes it seem very unlikely that this account is factual
- Traditional accounts like this in Islamic texts are almost always much more documented
- Another clue we have is that after Muhammad's forces overwhelm and capture the Jewish tribe and has them tied up, Muhammad still wants to kill them, even though they are no longer a threat
- Later Muhammad would state (according to al-Tabari) that he was afraid of the Qaynuqa
- A critical take on this situation is that possibly Muhammad's forces invented the situation with the Arab woman as a reason to start a war with this tribe they wanted to get rid of because they were afraid of them
- It seems likely that the historical account here is written in a way to scare the enemeies of the Muslims in that time (on purpose)
#### (Banu) Al-Nadir
- Al-Tabari notes that in A.H. 4, "Muhammad expelled the sons of Nadir from their homes."
- Took places after three events:
- - Expelling of the Banu Qaynuqa
- - The Massacre of the Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf
- - The killing of Abu Rafi, the Jew
- Possible reasons for getting rid of the Jews:
- - The Jews may have presented a threat against his authenticity as a prophet
- - The loss at Uhud might have left him in and desireous to redeem himself
- Muhammad tells his companions that he had "news from heaven" that al-Nadir was planning to kill him by dropping a rock on his head
- Muhammad then orders his people to prepare to fight the Jews
- Muhammad then marches with an army and plunders the Jews and burns their palm trees, which was a slap in the face of the Jews
- The Jews for their part surrendered and left their home with their gold, silver, and weapons
- The Muslim account does not clearly state why the Jews were required to contribute blood-money (the thing that started Muhammad's conflict with al-Nadir)
- Almost one year before this, Muhammad massacred Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf, the notable Jew whose mother is from this very tribe
- This particular account does not really give any "spread of Islam" reasons. It seems almost exclusively motivated by politics and fears
- It seems odd that Allah would not warn Muhammad about the plot to kill him before they were down with al-Nadir
- How would al-Nadir have even tried to drop a rock on someone surrounded by his men?
- Even knowing that Muhammd was marching towards them, al-Nadir still sought peaceful relations and refused to fight


## Lecture 17

### Breaking with the Jews (cont)

#### (Banu) Qurayza
- Muslim accounts call this "Ghazwat Bani Qurayza" (the raid of Banu Qurayza) but it seems more like a massacre
- This takes place right after the Battle of the Trench
- Gabriel instructs Muhammad to immediately march on Banu Qurayza
- Muhammad and the Muslims "siezed" the tribe for nrealy 25 days (some accounts say a month)
- This is basically a blockade or a seige, where their tent city is surrounded and prevented from leaving the area
- This is pretty bad, because that's all of your livelihood, and it basically prevents them from going about their lives
- "Allah cast terror into their hearts"
- This Jewish group did not really do anything to the Muslims
- Muhammad asks them if they will accept the ruling of one of their own
- Muhammad selects Sa'd ibn Mu'adh to pass judgment on them, without telling them that this person had already converted to Islam and given his loyalty to Muhammad
- The Jews agree, likely because they still don't understand what is happening here, because they do not appear to have done anything
- Their guy (Sa'd) decrees that "The men should be killed, the property divided, and the women and children taken as captives."
- Muhammad goes to the market and has several trenches dug and cut off the heads of all the Jewish men into those trenches
#### Critical Analysis
- This is difficult to hold in tension with the current trend of saying that Muhammad is the prophet of peace and tolerance
- Muhammad then divides the spoils of this tribe and sells the captive women to buy horses and weapons
- Muhammad did keep one of the Jewish women for himself, though she (Rayhana bint Zayd) refused to abandon Judaism for Islam
- This raid creates problems for the argument that the early Muslim raids were exclusively for religious reasons (defense or proclaiming Islam)
- Often it is suggested that this tribe broke faith with the Muslims
- This is hard to use as a justification when you sell the women and children who never participated in any battles
- There is no textual evidence that Muhammad offered the Qurayza a chance to convert to Islam
- He also did not only kill men, but all males who had pubic hair, so even some teenage boys
- the death toll ranges from as low as 600 to as high as 900 depending on the report
- This appears to be more of a massacre

#### Khaybar and Fadak
- The situation with Khaybar illustrates that Muhammad had gained enough power to balance tensions with the Meccans and allowed him to focus more on eliminating the Jews in his region
- Ibn Hisham and al-Tabari point out that Muhammad initiated the raid against Khaybar (obviously not for self-defense)
- Al-Baladhuri states "Muhammad invaded Khaybar in the year 7"
- Allegedly the chief of Khaybar's wife wanted a new husband and she really wanted Muhammad (the "king of the Hijaz")
- Muhammad arrives at Khaybar and demands a hidden treasure of al-Nadir that the people of Khaybar say they know nothing about
- Allegedly Muhammad's men then find the treasure somewhere and Muhammad commands the chief to be killed in as humiliating of a way as possible: they kindled a fire on Kinana's chest until he was nearly dead and then Muhammad bin Maslama struck off his head
- After the killing of Kinana, his wife was given to Sofiyya
- Evidently during this situation, some of the Muslim men raped pregnant Jewish women, which caused Muhammad to forbid that kind of thing
- Muhammad then kept all of the possessions for himself
#### Fadak
- When Fadak heard of what happened, they gave up before Muhammad even arrived
- Ibn Hisham writes that they asked for Muhammad to spare their lives and they would leave him their property, so he (Muhammad) did so
- In this way, the last Jewish community in Arabia was given "entirely and completely" to Muhammad
#### Critical Analysis
- Both of these raids appear to be completely politically motivated
- There is no evidence for religious reasons (no proclamation of Islam)
- The Muslim warriors raping pregnant women and the chief of Khaybar's humilitating murder make any kind of religious values impossible

#### The Conquest of Mecca
- Appears in the Muslim accounts as a negotiated surrender
- This happens because the Meccans apparently broke the treaty of Hudaybiyya
- It appears that the Meccas did not truly attempt to break the treaty because they were aware of the growing power of the Muslims
- Abu Sufyan, actually came to Muhammad to negotiate with him because he heard that there was talk they had broke the treaty
- The treaty could have been kept, because Mecca was willing to do whatever necessary to maintain peace with the Muslims
- Abu Sufyan converts to Islam during his dialog with Muhammad, admitting his submission to Muhammad
- Abu Sufyan never is truly convinced of Muhammad's prophethood
- Ibn Hisham has an account in the biography of Muhammad that states that Abu Sufyan still had "some doubt" about Muhammad's prophethood
- Abu Sufyan's conversion meant that Mecca had lost its leader
- This shows that the battle was over before it started
- Abu Sufyan saw the power of the Muslim soldiers and was competely in awe/fear
