### The motivations behind raids and conquests (religious, or something else?)

- There has been a suggestion that raids and conquests from Muhammad are entirely defensive
- on July 29, 2012, Sheikh 'Ali Jum'a said that the great conquests were a significant factor in the spread of Islam with its tolerance and justice throughout the world
- Conquests associated with spreading shared values

- Yusuuf al-Qaradawi suggested that conquests were to:
- - supress the tyrant authorities of the Byzantines and Persions, which were standing in the way of people accepting Islam
- - Functioned as preventative wars
- - To liberate oppressed and vulnerable people in the conquered lands
- No mention of dominion or economic gain as motivating reasons
- Abbas Mahmud al-'Aqqad in his apologetic explanation of jihad says that conquests were launded to
- - spread "the ethics of the Islamic tennets, aiming at offering justice, tolerance, and protecting the poor"
- Ahmad al-Sharif argues that the raids of Muhammad were to proclaim the Islamic call
- Classical Muslims approached the topic from the same standpoint
- Abu al-Rabi' al-Kala'I said that through these battles Allah empowered or stengthened the faith of/and the believers
- Ibn Taymiyya said that:
- - Muhammad and Islam were sent ALSO to the people of the Book, and so they were meant to call "the Jews and Christians to believe in him [Muhammad]."
- - Allah revealed the Verse of the Sword to affirm striving against the polytheists and the People of the Book
- Therefore we can see that Ibn Taymiyya appears to connect military raids to religious motivations as well
- The above shows that religious motivation is the interpretation of raids was used throughout the history of Islam
- All of these views seek to legitimize raids and conquests by portraying them as apologetic in nature
- Sayyid Abu al-A 'la Mawdudi contrasted secular wars and Muslim military activities, and says that Muslim fighting had nothing to do with "sword and fighting" except for self-defence
- He argues that Muslims conquests were "for Allah's sake or in Allah's path" while other wars are for "despicable lust, wicked desires, and reprehensible ambitions" of the commanders
- Muhammad Abdel Haleem points out that the Qur'anic term jihad is often misunderstood by non-Muslims, and says that "jihad" has nothing military about it
- Abdel Haleem states that "the Qur'an simply reassured the Muslims that they could defend themselves when attacked."
- Safi al-Rehman al-Mubarakpuri argued that Muslim raids were for the Muslims to gain freedom to live peacefully and spread Islam without restrictions"
- - This is troubling, because they were in fact free during these periods and people were seeking (see Battle of Badr lead-up) to avoid conflict with them
- - He argues that war is a way of bringing victory to the oppressed and supression to the oppressor"
- - He argues that it was to free people from worshipping 'al-ibad (created beings)
- Taha Hussain states that Abu Bakr's raids were a continuation of what Muhammad had already begun, and that they were to defend the Muslim territory (though history does not seem to agree)
- Many Muslim scholars do not adopt this religious washing of the raids and conquests
- Sayyid Mahmud al-Qimany demonstrates the political expansion of the early Muslim umma as "a call for a national unity under the leadership of a prophet, who is the founder of one central state."
- - He portrays Muhammad as a clever leader and a skillful warrior
- 'Abdul-Karim, like al-Qimany, portrays the Muslim conquests as invasions that sought the money and posessions of the conquered lands, which resulted in the umma's enrichment while the conquered people starved
- He states that the conquering armies "killed men even after they gave in, captured women and maids, burned castles and destroyed the remnants, plundering possessions of all kinds, forcing taxes on conquered people, and such."
- The phrase "religious motivation" for the raids and conquests refers to the traditional hypothetical claim about Muslim military activity and how it was all in self-defence
- this phrase/idea clearly adopts an apologetic stance for reading and interpreting the military history of Islam


## Lecture 15

### The Battle of Uhud (Muhammad at Medina cont)

- The Battle of Uhud was the second major battle that was commissioned by Muhammad
- The Battle of Uhud took place one year after the Battle of Badr
- Abu Sufyan determined this was the time for the two sides to clash again
- Seven days after Badr, Muhammad led the raid against the sons of Salim which resulted in another victory
- Then Abu Sufyan led a raid against the Muslims in al-Sawiq
- Additional small raids then took place: Ghaswat Dhi Amr and Bahran (not as important to know)
- The Battle of uhud took place as a culmination of these many smaller earlier raids
- We do not have a lot of verifiable historical information, because the majority of information comes from Muslim writers that have a particular slant or bias (like all historians)
- Muslim army initially had 1,000 men, but about 300 left to follow someone else because they didn't believe this battle would go well
- The Meccans had 3,000 men AND Khalid Ibn al-Walid (remember this name for later)
- The Meccans (according to Muslim sources) brought women to the battle to "rouse the warriors" (not sure what that means)
- Muslims were not in consensus about participating in the battle, and Muhammad actually received a divine vision telling him not to leave Medina to go to Uhud (though he still did)
- Initially the Muslims gained a quick victory and an early lead
- However, when the battle was almost won by the Muslims, some of the Muslim archers left their positions against Muhammad's orders to try and gain some of the spoils of war
- Because of this, many Muslims were killed and Muhammad was severely injured
- Muslims then technically lost the battle, but according to Muslim historians, it's still a victory BECAUSE it started as a victory which was all Allah promised
#### Critical Analysis
- Muhammad's divine guidance is tenuous because he had a hesitation to go
- Muslims as a whole could not decide if they should go to war or not
- Even though Muhammad allegedly received a divine vision stating they would slay their enemies (but there is no mention of Gabriel this time like normal...)
- The Muslims who decided not to go to the battle were the 300 mentioned earlier
- The man leading the ones who left (Abdullah ibn Ubayy) seemed more skillful and competant than Muhammad in this version
- The idea that initial victory being equated with "true victory" and then the downfall later being of no consequence is difficult to believe with the rest of Islamic thought and scholarship
- The argument that people leaving was the problem is difficult because initially Muhammad wanted to join those people!
- A more persuasive reason for the loss is that the Meccans were simply much better prepared and their leader was more skillful in choosing his time for battle and preparing his soldiers
- Going back to the archers, why was there such a great desire to leave their position? Because they wanted and probably needed the spoils of war
- There is no arguement to be made that they were looking to proclaim Islam at another spot in the battlefield
- Why not wait until the battle was over?
- It seems that they (the archers) were not as confident that the spoils were going to be dealt out fairly (they had "loot lust")
#### Preparation for the Conquest of Mecca
- This is called "The conquest of the Conquests"
- This brings us back to the matter of the Jews
- Muhammad needed to now break with the Jewish tribes of Medina
- These tribes:
- - Qaynuqa'
- - al-Nadir
- - Qurayza
- And two Jewish Settlements near Medina
- - Khaybar
- - Fadak
- Bringing these tribes under his control will solidify his control over Medina and the surrounding areas
- This would bring the break with the prayer direction as well, as Allah would now change the Qibla to be towards Mecca instead of Jerusalem (around the battle of Badr)
