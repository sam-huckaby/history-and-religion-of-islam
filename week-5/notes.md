## Lecture 18

### Appointment of Abu Bakr
- Muhammad conquered Mecca in year 8, and then died two years later
- Traditions are split on how Muhammad died, or more rightly, who killed him
- - One group (Sunni) asserts it was a Jewish woman via poison
- - One group (Shi'i) asserts it was Aisha and others of Muhammad's companions
- - this second group does not believe that Abu Bakr should have been appointed, but instead Ali should have been the first caliph, or imam
- There are doubts at this point that the Umayyas are in fact loyal to Muhammad, though they are now on his side since Abu Sufyan submitted to Islam/Muhammad
- Later Muawiyah bin Sufiyan will become a caliph later in the line of Umayya
- There is still a lot of tension between the two branches of Muhammad's family, especially between Muhammad's line and the Umayyads
- Now that Muhammad has died, there is a vacuum of power and not a clear person to take over
- Shi'ia are very pro-Ali because he is part of Muhammad's family
- Sunni are very pro-Abu Bakr because of tradition, which is mostly in place because of the caliphs who came immediately after Muhammad shifted power towards the Umayyads
- The Medinan people want the power to fall to someone from their tribes (because that was where Muhammad was when he died)
- They met in the Saqifa when Muhammad died (rather than caring for the body of their former leader) to discuss who would take over leadership
- We can see a split between the Medinan supporters and the Meccan immigrants, and there does not appear to be a strong unity in the Umma (Muslim community) at this point
- It appears that the Medinan supporters moved quickly to appoint a new leader as soon as Muhammad died, while the Meccans were still in shock from Muhammad's death
- The Meccan immigrants were not initially told this meeting was happening, but when they found out, they (Abu Bakr and Umar) rushed to the meeting
- Sunni tradition is that there was a dispute over who was to be appointed
- Shi'i tradition argues that there was a clear appointment of Ali
- Al-Tabari writes that the Medinan supporters were already ready to accept Ali
- Abu Bakr and his confidants were not willing to give power to Ali even though some of the Meccan immigrants even weren't in support of him having control
- Abu Bakr's leadership was forced on the community by Umar
- While everything in Islam was generally painted as anti-Jewish at this time, it could be believed that Abu Bakr and his confidants (including Aisha) poisoned Muhammad
- Sunni tradition however would argue that it was a Jewish woman who killed Muhammad with poison, but you can see how that would make a good smoke screen
- al-Zubayr and Ali did NOT support Abu Bakr's appointment at all
- Even the two major sides were in ways fractured
- Abu Bakr and Umar had their own conflicts
- Ali and al-Zubayr had their own conflicts
- Ali waited six months to give Abu Bakr the oath of loyalty
- The Medinan Muslims were initially in favor of Sa'd becoming the new leader
- Sa'd was found dead the same day, and Abu Bakr claimed it was Allah who killed him
- Ali even claimed to Abu Bakr in front of many that he (and the Bani Hashim) had the right of leadership, but Abu Bakr domineered over them
- Abu Sufyan desired for Ali to be caliph still and offered to bring troops to fight Abu Bakr, but Ali desired peace
- Abu Bakr declared that any Muslim that did not give him the oath of allegiance they would be considered apostate or about to become apostate
- Unfortunately there are many contradictory reports of what happened at the Saqifa (meeting place where they chose the next leader) and it is highly disputed
- We can say some things with certainty
- - The Medinan supporters wanted a caliph from themselves and they were planning to appoint Sa'd
- - The Meccan immigrants led by Abu Bakr hastened to join the meeting and rejected Sa'd and said it must be Abu Bakr
- - The Medinans refused Abu Bakr and conceded they would accept Ali
- - Abu Bakr was appointed caliph, Sa'd was found dead, and none of Banu Hashim gave the oath of loyalty for six months
- Rashidon => Rightly guided caliphs
- - Abu Bakr (triggered the Apostasy wars because so many people left the faith when he took over)
- - Umar (assassinated)
- - Uthman (assassinated)
- - Ali (Moved the capital to Kufa - Iraq)
- Notable dates:
- - Rule over Arabia (632-634) - Abu Bakr
- - Conquest of Persia (634-652)- Umar and Uthman
- - Conquest of Syria (636-637) - Umar
- - Conquest of Egypt (639-642) - Umar

## Lecture 19

### The Apostasy Wars
- Abu Bakr's appointment triggered a large group of Muslims leaving the faith because they did not agree with his appointment
- So he attacked them to bring them back under his control (because he was losing a lot of income by not having them as subjects)
- Abu Bakr would only live for two years after this point, so he would not see all of the fruit of the Apostasy Wars
- Abu Bakr also began the early conquests to the Byzantine and Persian frontiers during these two years
- The Apostasy Wars would effectually reach to all areas of Arabia to forcibly bring all apostates back under his control
- Abu Bakr ordered the Apostasy Wars to force apostates to return to paying zakat (tax) and to remove anyone who claimed prophethood after Muhammad
- Who was really targeted in any given situation is not always clear. Most of the history written on this topic is written to put Abu Bakr in a good light, so it is very favorable towards him
- In Traditional Sunni Islam
- - The Apostasy Wars were religiously driven
- - Anyone who quit for one or more of:
- - - Refusing Islam altogether
- - - Claiming prophethood
- - - refusing or prohibiting the payment of zakat (taxes)
- - These wars were necessary to preserve Islam
- - Apostates were given three options: submission, exile, or death
- - For traditionalists, there is no real difference between religion, life affairs, and politics, they are all the same sphere
- - Therefore there was not a big difference to the fighters when it came to WHY the person they were fighting was an apostate
- - There are some traditionalists which would say the wars was religious AND political, because Islam was being denied and because the political structure needed to be saved to ensure stability
- - Therefore the Sunni approach is that the Apostasy Wars were mostly religious in nature
- In Traditional Shi'i Islam:
- - Ja'far Murtada (in a biography of Ali) argues that the wars were likely more about those who refused to pay zakat
- - People must differentiate between those who were Abu Bakr's enemies and those who were leaving Islam
- - He also argues that the Apostasy Wars were mainly wars against Abu Bakr's opponents
- - They argue that Arabs were expecting Ali to take over from Muhammad and were confused when that did not happen
- - This confusion prevented them from immediately accepting Abu Bakr's appointment
- - Abu Bakr needed to be sure they would not revolt against him
- - Abu Bakr therefore needed to attack people that did not agree with his appointment to force them to submit
- - They did not think Abu Bakr was that pious and were not willing to submit to him
- - They would argue that the people being attacked were not refusing to pay zakat, but rather refused to pay it to Abu Bakr
- - Abu Bakr then attacked them to supress the movement away from him and used his victories to paint the history books in his favor
- - Abu Bakr is not really a legitimate caliph
- Non-Muslim Scholars say:
- - Mainly agree with the Sunni position and see the wars as against those not willing to pay the zakat
- - William Muir points out that the Muslim tradition links Apostasy wars to the preservation of the true religioin estalished by the prophet
- - Muir appears to be far less critical of Muslim (Sunni) positions
- - Muir also doesn't leave much distinction between those who left the faith and those who just refused to pay zakat to Abu Bakr
- - Most Western scholars will fall into this same category of arguing for Sunni standpoints
- Muslim scholars say:
- - Abu Bakr recognized al-zakat as a pillar of Islam, and therefore it NEEDED to be protected and fought for
- - (this seems a little odd, because it is such an edge case. Most would not be willing to launch a war if people stopped praying - another pillar)
- - Sayyid Mahmud Al-Qimany writes that the non-Muslim Arabs did not accept Abu Bakr as caliph because they were not consulted
- - He also argues that Abu Bakr transformed the political conflict into a religious one in order to make it valid
- - Al-Qimany observes that the groups being attacked were still willing to pay zakat, just not to Abu Bakr, instead using it support their poor
- Ultimately, we need to see that the issue of the Apostasy Wars is complex
- We cannot even say for sure which tradition about the wars is right
- Understanding the possible motivations behind the wars is important though, because they served to launch the conquests that would establish the entire empire of the Islamic State
- Abu Bakr may or may not have been concerned with those leaving the faith, but he certainly wanted to solidify his political position of power
- Religious reasons for these wars, whether true or not, served to make the situation acceptable politically and setup advancement in the ranks of the community

## Lecture 20

### The results of the Apostasy Wars
- War brings war
- Power was gained throughout the empire
- Khalid ibn Al-Walid was a very important military figure, but he became a Muslim later in life and his conversion is suspect
- Khalid was also very brutal in his warfare, he was noted as a very effective military commander

### Khalid's Expedition to Iraq
- This conquest took place in (12/633) and overlapped with the Apostasy Wars
- He targetted the NOrthern Hejaz regions where the Byzantines and the Persian empire were
- Abu Bakr "ordered Khalid to march to Iraq" (does not seem to be to proclaim Islam)
- This expedition served as a transition from the Apostasy Wars to the early conquests (Persia, Egypt, etc)
- Khalid marched to various Persia-controlled lands in the frontier of Iraq and either conquered through force or through peace treaties
- Inhabitants were offered the three choices:
- - Accept Islam
- - Pay the tribute (Jizya)
- - Or fight him to survive
- These are very small tribes, and would almost never choose to fight
- Khalid would roam the land and upon reaching a city he would "open it" (conquer or invade it successfully) and took its people captive
- Non-Arab kinds he defeated and killed
- al-Tabari states "Khalid came to the Anbar and in return for peace they were evacuated from their lands... then he attacked Suq Baghdad... and raided Suq Quda'a ...and plundered what was in it... then marched to 'Ayn al-Tamr and conquered it by force and murdered and took captives, senting the captives to Abu Bakr... Then marched to Dumat al-jandal and killed its governer Ukaydar and took his son captive
- There is no mention of spreading Islam, these conquests appear to be completely for the benefit of expanding control of the empire and building resources
- In most cases, religion during this period served simply as a glue to hold people together
### Critical Analysis of Khalid's Expeditions
- This appears to be best viewed as a part of the Apostasy Wars, since those wars also did not seek to really proclaim Islam
- Khalid did not attempt to fight his way into Persia, which would be expected if he was seeking to proclaim Islam (Allah would surely protect and favor him)
- Between the murders and captives and taxing that was going on, there was not much time to proclaim a religious message 
- It seems that this conquest was mainly out of lust for power
- Muslim author Abdul-Karim points out that during the conquests the Muslim companions were lustful for economic gain, as they lived with scare resources prior to the gain they received from the conquests
- he observes that the cruel and brutal actions taken against the people refute any idea that Islam was being offered
- Some traditionalists will argue that Khalid offered conquered inhabitants the choice of Islam
- Offering Islam (if he did) does not necessarily mean his driving force was religious though
- Any offers of submitting to Islam was in view of making sure the allegiance to the Muslim government was established
- This limited expedition appears to be mainly (or only) for political security
- Khalid stopping before going into Persia at all seems to be a highly calculated move, that was likely planned out BEFORE he embarked on these expeditions
- When Khalid attacked al-Hira, he was willing to accept the jizya from the inhabitants as long as they were willing "to be spies for his sake"
- This suggests that he was mainly interested in their loyalty and nothing more
- It also captured strongholds that would ultimately be necessary for protection in the future against the Persian empire
- We must remember it is IMPOSSIBLE to determine the real motivations of Abu Bakr or Khalid
- All of these things are simply what the Muslim scholars wrote for us to know from that time period
- We must recognize that these accounts provide us with a possible view of motivation that we must decode from the words of people who lived long ago

## Lecture 21

### Conquest of Eqypt
- Muslim views will typically be that these conquests were to "open the land"
- Traditional claims will also be that these conquests are all defensive in nature
- Our study this far has not provided us much evidence for these facts though
- Histories that can be read: Ibn 'Abd al-Hakam on Conquest of Egypt
- During Abu Bakr's caliphate, the Arab Muslim expansion moved out of the Arabian Peninsula into Iraq and Syria after controlling the Hijaz
- Umar continued the task of conquering Syria, followed afterwards by the conquest of Egypt and North Africa
- ^ Victory brings victory, war brings war
- This seems to be a natural flow
- Ibn 'Abd al-Hakam wrote much on the conquest of Egypt
- - His work was written hundreds of years after the fact
- - His documents begin with Muhammad's commandment concerning conquering Egypt
- - Muhammd commanded his followers "If you conquer Egypt, take good care of the Copts as I have marital kinship with them."
- - Worth noting that this work was written when Muslims already had conquered Egypt, so it's a bit of a look at the past that may be justifying things
- - He will list various prophecy's from Muhammad about conquering Egypt
- - These prophecies do not have a lot of evidence to back up that they were actually said, since they were recorded hundreds of years after the fact
- - He seems to establish the historical account of the Conquest of Egypt based on Muhammad's communication with its ruler before he died. (specifically a letter to al-Muqawqis, the patriarch of Alexandria)
- - This is the only place that gives any evidence that this letter exists
- - In this letter, Muhammad called the viceregent of the Copts (al-Muqawqis) to Islam
- - The viceregent supposedly responded that he read the letter and understood that another prophet must come, but expected it to be from Syria
- - He apparently then sent two slace women to Muhammad with gifts (which seems pretty suspicious, since a Christian would be against slavery in this fashion)
- - Amr ibn Al-'As, saved a Christian deacon's life twice in Jerusalem who encouraged him to go to Egypt to seek wealth and material gain
- - Amr is astounded by the beauty and splendor of Egypt when he arrives, and falls in love with its abundance of wealth
- - Amr then speaks to the caliph Umar encouraging him to send Muslim armies to "open" Egypt to conquer it because it will offer the Muslims much power
- - Umar was not initially in favor of the conquest, but eventually agreed to send 4,000 warriors under the command of Amr to conquer Egypt
### Critical Analysis of this account
- It seems obvious that Amr was motivated to conquer Egypt because of its wealth and strategic location
- Nothing is mentioned about proclaiming Islam in the text itself
- Amr also notes that Egypt is the weakest militarily in the region and would be easy to conquer
- It appears that a weak military and an abundance of wealth were the key reasons for conquering Egypt
- again we need to note that modern Muslims will often argue that these conquests were religiously motivated, which seems difficult to connect to these accoutns from Muslim historians

## Lecture 22

### Analyzing the Conquest of Egypt
- Umar was reluctant to launch the invasion
- Amr initiated the plan to conquer Egypt and convinced the Caliph based on non-religious declarations
- If Umar was really fulfilling Muhammad's prophecy, he should not have been reluctant, so it casts doubt on 'Abd al-Hakam's supposed prophecies from Muhammad
- It seems likely that political measures and economic concerns were of the highest priority to these historical Muslims (even higher than religious priorities)
- Upon conquering the land, Amr and al-Zubayr had a severe disagreement (according to al-Baladhuri) over dividing the lands and fought each other and had to send a letter to consult the Caliph
- This seems to imply that the real motivation for being here was capture of land and resources
- There also seems to be evidence that these early Muslim leaders were evaluating conquered lands before they conquered them
- When al-Zubayr was told to march on Egypt, he argued that he did not like that land because it has only "stabbing and plague".
- Even though the wealth is apparently quite great in Egypt, the land itself is not great, and that made it less desirable to this important military figure
- There are also accounts of Muslims where tax money was mishandled, suggesting that money was something people did indeed want
- Amr was accused of stealing from the taxes, Umar (the Caliph) was very upset with him which suggests that the economic gain was the main thing that the Caliph was worried about
- Amr was then subsequently dismissed by Uthman and the next guy was accused of stealing as well and also dismissed
- North Africa eventually went bankrupt from all of the taxes and gifts that the Muslim conquerers exacted from them
- This suggests that wealth and gain was the primary motive for conquest
- It might be suggested that the Arabs came in and captured Egypt and occupied it and that occupation continues to this day
- If the Arabs had arrived solely to proclaim Islam, why did they not return to the Hijaz on completion of their mission?
- They conquered the Byzantine empire which had never attacked them.
- If the religious message was one of liberation, why did the conquered people have to pay tribute or be sent as prisoners out of the region to Medina/Mecca/elsewhere (or be killed)?
- At the end of these conquests, the Muslim Empire stretches as far as the Atlantic

### The first 100 years
- The Rashidun (632-661) Rule from Medina
- Al-Khulafa ar-rashidun (the rightly guided caliphs)
- Sadr al-Islam - "Early Islamic era (Shiite)"
- Abu Bakr (632-634)
- Umar (634-644)
- Uthman (644-656)
- Ali (656-661)
- Muhammad conquers about half the arabian peninsula (the Southwest)
- Abu Bakr's Apostasy wars and conquests conquer the rest of the peninsula
- The remaining reigns move into Egypt, Syria, Armenia, and Persia
- They made it all the way to the edge of India

### The Umayyad Caliphate/Dynasty (661-749)
- They were overthrown by the Abbasid Caliphate and fled across North Africa to Al-Andalus, where they established Khilafat Qurtuba
- The tenth caliphate saw the greatest expansion from China to the South of France
- This group was the opposite side of Muhammad's family tree
- This group would then propel this individual family further and further into power
- We must remember that the history around this Caliphate/Dynasty is written by these groups, 200+ years after the events take place
- There are possible "fixes" in place to make things more favorable
- We must recognize that this is the history that today's Muslims know and are taught, so it is important to know, because it makes up their culture and tradition
- Whether we believe it as truth or not, it is important to meet people where they are and understand what they believe, not simply for critique but to understand why they choose to believe and act in different ways than we do
