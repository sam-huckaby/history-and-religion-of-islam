# Week Two Notes
## Lecture 4

### Beginning to study Muhammad’s life
His life/background is broken up into:

We must keep in mind the geography of Saudi Arabia during our learning, because most of this took place in Al Hijaz (the mountain range on the west of Saudi Arabia)

#### Muhammad’s family
- We must ask: How do Muslims want to portray Muhammad?
- - Muslims were originally interacting with Jews/Christians, and so they were working to portray the Qur’an as a perfect word, and give these other groups a reason to join them.
- - It was important for them to link Muhammad all the way back to Abraham, because Jews and Christians connected to Abraham.
- - Hagar even drank from a well by Mecca! (though it is poisonous, but that’s not important, it's the religious importance)
- - A desire for legitimacy
- - A desire to be connected to a patriarch that is respected by Christians and Jews
- Muhammad was born up to four years after his “father” died
- Some Muslims even hold to a thought that a woman could have a baby inside her womb for UP TO SEVEN YEARS. It’s not true, but it’s desirable to offer some kind of legitimacy.
- Born in 570 in Mecca
- Mother Amina and father Abdullah (means servant of Allah)
- Banu Hashim(?) Important tribe **IMPORTANT**
- From the tribe of Quraysh **IMPORTANT**
- In his youth, he was a shepherd/merchant and known for his honesty and trustworthiness
- Worked for a wealthy woman named Khadija as her caravan leader
- Khadija had been married twice before Muhammad
- Khadija may have been a Christian, Muhammad did not marry anyone else while she lived and she had a Christian priest for a cousin
- Khadija Married Muhammad when he was 25 and she was 40
- Spent a lot of time in solitude in the wilderness
- He was visited in a cave by an angel (Gabriel) and sought to kill himself after that visit because he was so afraid
- Gabriel said that Muhammad was “the prophet” and that he was sent as a messenger to give him the news from Allah.
- Khadija's cousin helps Muhammad and tells him "you are the prophet to the Arabs!"
#### Muhammad at Mecca
- Mecca is believed to have had 365 idols setup, one for each day
- Lived in Mecca for 13 years
- Muslims believe that Jesus and Moses proclaimed the same message as Moses and Jesus (that God is one)
- Muhammad was sent because people did not listen to Moses and Jesus
- The Quraysh persecuted Muhammad for his beliefs
- Allah tells Muhammad to move to Medina because the persecution is so great
#### Muhammad at Medina
- Migrated to Medina for 10 years bringing along 30 men (his followers)
- He grew in power because he was very shrewd
- Started sending raids against the Quraysh and Jews
- Began to raid and capture Mecca near the end
- Died in 632 by poison that was given to him by a Jewish woman (Sunni tradition)
- Died in 632 by poison from his own people to take his power (Shiite tradition)
- Abu Bakar takes on leadership from Muhammad (the fist Caliphate)
- Many Muslims abandoned Islam when Muhammad died
- We will study the first four caliphates
- Muhammad’s life was viewed as the blueprint for best understanding the Qur’an
- Muhammad lived in two places, and the Qur’an is exposited in two parts
- The Medina portion of the Qur’an is thought to overtake and overrule (abrogate) the portion written in Mecca
- Family tree diagram is very important.
- Banu Umayya and Banu Hashim constantly fought after (even the day of) Muhammad’s death.
- Muhammad’s branch of the family tree is contrasted with the branch that contains Abu Sufyan (the Umayya side of the tree, from Abdeshams)
- Abu Sufyan was on the Quraysh side of the battles with Mecca
- The family of Muhammad is more Shiite (the Hashim side)
- Banu Umayya is more Sunni
- Muslims tend to portray their history as a nice and well-constructed history that Allah used to build his empire
- However, history/archeology does not hold the same view of their history.
