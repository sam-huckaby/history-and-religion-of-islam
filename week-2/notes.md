# Week Two Notes
## Lecture 4

### Beginning to study Muhammad’s life
His life/background is broken up into:

We must keep in mind the geography of Saudi Arabia during our learning, because most of this took place in Al Hijaz (the mountain range on the west of Saudi Arabia)

#### Muhammad’s family
- We must ask: How do Muslims want to portray Muhammad?
- - Muslims were originally interacting with Jews/Christians, and so they were working to portray the Qur’an as a perfect word, and give these other groups a reason to join them.
- - It was important for them to link Muhammad all the way back to Abraham, because Jews and Christians connected to Abraham.
- - Hagar even drank from a well by Mecca! (though it is poisonous, but that’s not important, it's the religious importance)
- - A desire for legitimacy
- - A desire to be connected to a patriarch that is respected by Christians and Jews
- Muhammad was born up to four years after his “father” died
- Some Muslims even hold to a thought that a woman could have a baby inside her womb for UP TO SEVEN YEARS. It’s not true, but it’s desirable to offer some kind of legitimacy.
- Born in 570 in Mecca
- Mother Amina and father Abdullah (means servant of Allah)
- Banu Hashim(?) Important tribe **IMPORTANT**
- From the tribe of Quraysh **IMPORTANT**
- In his youth, he was a shepherd/merchant and known for his honesty and trustworthiness
- Worked for a wealthy woman named Khadija as her caravan leader
- Khadija had been married twice before Muhammad
- Khadija may have been a Christian, Muhammad did not marry anyone else while she lived and she had a Christian priest for a cousin
- Khadija Married Muhammad when he was 25 and she was 40
- Spent a lot of time in solitude in the wilderness
- He was visited in a cave by an angel (Gabriel) and sought to kill himself after that visit because he was so afraid
- Gabriel said that Muhammad was “the prophet” and that he was sent as a messenger to give him the news from Allah.
- Khadija's cousin helps Muhammad and tells him "you are the prophet to the Arabs!"
#### Muhammad at Mecca
- Mecca is believed to have had 365 idols setup, one for each day
- Lived in Mecca for 13 years
- Muslims believe that Jesus and Moses proclaimed the same message as Moses and Jesus (that God is one)
- Muhammad was sent because people did not listen to Moses and Jesus
- The Quraysh persecuted Muhammad for his beliefs
- Allah tells Muhammad to move to Medina because the persecution is so great
#### Muhammad at Medina
- Migrated to Medina for 10 years bringing along 30 men (his followers)
- He grew in power because he was very shrewd
- Started sending raids against the Quraysh and Jews
- Began to raid and capture Mecca near the end
- Died in 632 by poison that was given to him by a Jewish woman (Sunni tradition)
- Died in 632 by poison from his own people to take his power (Shiite tradition)
- Abu Bakar takes on leadership from Muhammad (the fist Caliphate)
- Many Muslims abandoned Islam when Muhammad died
- We will study the first four caliphates
- Muhammad’s life was viewed as the blueprint for best understanding the Qur’an
- Muhammad lived in two places, and the Qur’an is exposited in two parts
- The Medina portion of the Qur’an is thought to overtake and overrule (abrogate) the portion written in Mecca
- Family tree diagram is very important.
- Banu Umayya and Banu Hashim constantly fought after (even the day of) Muhammad’s death.
- Muhammad’s branch of the family tree is contrasted with the branch that contains Abu Sufyan (the Umayya side of the tree, from Abdeshams)
- Abu Sufyan was on the Quraysh side of the battles with Mecca
- The family of Muhammad is more Shiite (the Hashim side)
- Banu Umayya is more Sunni
- Muslims tend to portray their history as a nice and well-constructed history that Allah used to build his empire
- However, history/archeology does not hold the same view of their history.


## Lecture 5
In mecca there are two main families in this period: Banu Hashim & Banu Umayyah
Abd Manaf connects the two sides of the family
A lot of times political power is more important in most cases than religious power (as in most religions - including Christian history)
Shiite Muslims tended to desire for Ali to be in power, because he represented their interests and their side of the family
Sunni Muslims were represented by the Bani Umayya, so they preferred the Umayyad dynasty because it brought power to their side of the tree

### Historical background (Pre-Islamic)
Arabs during this period were mostly nomadic
there was a lot of resources being shuffled between people groups

Muhammad's tribe was made up of 3 groups:
- The priestly group (Controlled House of Worship) <- This was the most powerful group
- The trade group (brought goods and resources around to other coutnries)
- The water group (Provided water and other services to Pilgrims - relied on these pilgrims for income)

Male dominated society
Many idols
regular raiding -> not too different after Islam came into control
Jews were in Medina and were mostly in harmony with non-Jews
Mecca and Yathrib (Medina)
Muslims tend to believe that monotheism exists in pre-Islamic context
Muslims also tend NOT to believe that monotheism existed in pre-Islamic Mecca
- important because they desire for Islam to stand out as truly divine -- by saying Mecca is completely pagan
- This also means there were no Christians or Jews in Mecca 
- - which contradicts the story of Khadija's Christian cousin
- - and Muhammad's biography talks about a picture of Jesus and Mary in the Kabbah
- This is also contected to Muhammad's illiteracy -- Allah must have completely given the Qur'an
- There is a desire to make the Islamic message purely divine, apart from any human tampering

### The cultural background of Mecca
The Kabbah is the holiest thing on the planet
Mecca and the Ka'Ba are held up as glorious and of great importance
Mecca is held as important because in the Islamic view of history, Mecca is viewed as having two qualities:
- Idol worshipping happened there with regular pilgrimages
- It was an active center of commerce
The Qur'an describes the opponents as agriculturalists, which cultivated wheat, grapes, olives, and date palms (which do not grow in Mecca)
Wheat, grapes, and olives only grow in the North
Date palms grow in the South (in Yemen)
None of them grow in Mecca
Q 37:137 && 11:89 -> Allah is saying the Muslims pass by "Lot's people" which is closer to the dead sea likely
Patricia Crone argues that Mecca is only chosen in Islamic history because it provides the right context to apepear as though everything is arranged by Allah alone
Islamic history does not have outside sources, like Christianity, and so it seems to need to build some
- "Lives of the Twelve Caesars" - Mentions BOTH Christians AND Christ as an outside source
- The Acts 18:2 expulsion is mentioned in the biography of Emperor Claudius Divus
We really need independent sources to be able to confirm historical details, and we just do not have them for many of the details about pre-Islamic Mecca


## Lecture 6

We previously looked at Mecca from a Muslim perspective, trying to understand how a Muslim understands the history of Mecca
Now we will look at some scholarly critical views

### A critical look at the history of Mecca
People like Patricia Crone wrestle with the idea that Mecca could be everything that Islamic tradition has said about it.
There is a [documentary about Mecca's origins called "The Sacred City"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOnGvzVceVo)
Mecca is remembered as "The mother of all cities" by many Muslims
There is no archeological evidence for a city in this location until about 170 years after Muhammad's death
Only later Muslim sources tend to claim that Mecca was around prior to this period
There is concern among scholars that Mecca has been "invented" in some ways by Islamic historians
Mecca appears only once in the Qur'an (48:24)
"Becca" appears one time as well (3:96), but it is not implied it it the same place really, unless the Qur'an contains a spelling error by a scribe
7th century Byzantine map contains no reference to Mecca
6th century map also contains no reference to Mecca

Patricia Crone writes two works "Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam" and "What do we actually know about Muhammad?" both are well written and book is very accessible
First reference to Mecca is in 741, and no map shows Mecca until 900.
Yathrib, Ta'if, and Khaybar are seen in Greek trading documents, but never Mecca
There is no mention of Quraysh or their trading center, Mecca in all of the writings about Arabia from that time (Greek, Latin, Syriac, Aramaic, Coptic, or others)
Patricia Crone concludes that there was no outside trade with Mecca on the eve of Islam

Dan Gibson's "Early Islamic Qiblas: A survey of mosques built between 1AH/622 C.E."
Mosques were always to face Mecca
He searched for locations in the Qur'an and used satellite and internet images
None of them were near Mecca, (some were more than 600 miles)
None of these sites face Mecca
He argues that the original Qibla was Petra, not Mecca

This brings us to an important question: "Did Muhammad actually exist?"
There is no doubt that Muhammad DID exist. (though there are occasional attempts to disprove it, they always fall short)
check out the book by Hoyland "Seeing Islam as Others Saw It" **Good for research**
A Greek text written between 632 and 634 mentions a "false prophet" which appeared among the Saracens
He is dismissed as a false prophet because the author says that prophets do not come "with sword and chariot"
An Armenian document probably writtein shortly after 661 identifies Muhammad by name and details his monotheistic message
We do not really want to use the Qur'an as a source for proving Muhammad's existance because he is only mentioned four times in the entire work
People also sometimes argue that being in Syriac the Qur'an could have been in fact talking about Jesus (though that seems very unlikely)
Patricia Crone points out that outside sources mostly document the North and South ends of the peninsula, but nothing about the middle regions
Everything we know about Mecca and the Ka'ba (and the middle regions) comes from Islamic sources
Again, the opponents were described in the Qur'an as agriculturists that cultivate crops that did not grow in or around Mecca
Muhammad even says to the opponents that they should consider Lot's descendants that they pass by so often (which points to being located North of Arabia)

### How much can we really say about Islam from non-Islamic sources
- Muhammad was alone for his first encounter with an angel, so there were no witnesses
- The Qur'an was not cannonized until after Muhammad died, and we do not know where the compilers got their real authority to choose
- Uthmanic Standard Qur'an does not provide any proof for it's authority (or why he would be trusted to compile his own unique set of writings)
- The biogaphy of Muhammad was originally written 130 years after Muhammad died, was lost, and a new one was written almost 180 years after Muhammad's life and had no access to credible witnesses
- Even the Hadith was written 200+ years after Muhammad's life

It is difficult to say this is noth a man-made religion

All of the writings should be studied and questions about their authenticity should be considered


## Lecture 7

### The history of the Ka'ba
It is viewed as God's house
It is viewed with much reverence and great importance
The Qur'an does not actually say anything about this Ka'Ba
"Sacred house" (5:100) and "ancient house" (22:29) are mentioned
Tradition puts the construction of the Ka'Ba in Abraham and Ishmael's time, to legitimize it with history and religion
Prior to Islam, The Ka'Ba was mostly just a little stone hut, that housed idols of the region
- Hubal
- al-Uzza (Isis and Aphrodite, in other areas)
- al-Kutba
- Jesus and his holy mother, Mary
The Ka'ba in Islamic tradition is built up to hold the connections to the references that the Qur'an makes
The Ka'ba is traced back to pre-creation in Islamic thought and history
Sahih Bukhari - Legitimizes Mecca as a sacred city for the Ka'ba
- Volume 3, Book 34, Number 339
- Volume 2, Book 23, Number 432
- Volume 4, Book 52, Number 139
The Qur'an legitimizes the Ka'ba without calling it by name
Q 2:120-127
Abraham and Jesus and other prophets are listed as Muslims, because "Muslims" are "submitters to God"
Q 6:74-89
Q 2:127-135
Ishmael becomes the sole master of the Ka'Ba
The black stone in the center of the Ka'ba came from heaven
It was originally white when it came from heaven, but when all the Muslims touched it, it became black from their sins
Muhammad was assigned the task of putting it in place because he entered the area of the temple first
The stone is therefore considered in Islamic history to have been in that place since Muhammad placed it there
- Worth noting that the Ka'Ba has been razed and destroyed completely once since then
There is a mosque in Medina that has two directions of prayer, one towards Jerusalem (old) and one towards Mecca (current)
A Muslim will normally be told and believe that the Ka'ba and Qur'an as we have them are exactly as Muhammad had them

### Muhammad and his interactions with Christians
Muslim Scholars will often argue that Muhammad did not interact with Christians at all
There are two places in the Islamic texts that specifically refer to Muhammad interacting with Christians though
1. Waraqa ibn Nawfal was "Christian" and was Khadija's cousin who helped Muhammad understand his early revelations
- Ibn Ishaq's account specifically states that Khadija took Muhammad to Waraqa ibn Nawfal
- Waraqa cried "holy holy holy!" and stated that Muhammad had received the Law from the Lord
- Volume 1, Book 1, Number 3 - Sahih Bukhari
- Muhammad not being able to read also means he needs (per the biography) Waraqa
- The "divine inspiration" paused when Waraqa died and Muhammad was anxious about that
2. Bahira - the Christian monk that identified Muhammad as a prophet
- Bahira's story found in Muslim traditions written more than a century after the events happened
- This story is actually found in earlier texts by Christians!
- Bahira identifies the seal of prophethood on Muhammad's shoulder
- - Islam completes and corrects Christianity
- - Muhammad is the fulfillment of biblical prophets
- - Muhammad is a part of the struggle between paganism and monotheism
- Possible Critical interpretations of Bahira
- - Bahira taught Muhammad the truth about God (Christianity) but Muhammad distorted and mistook what he was taught
- - Bahira could also have just been an Arian, a Nestorian, a Jacobite, or some other kind false witness

These two people prove that Muhammad came in contact with AT LEAST two Christians, and they were early and formative interactions.


## Lecture 8

### Marriage and sexuality in pre-Islamic Arabia
Why is this important?
Pre-Islam there were raids and fighting among tribes
Post-Islam there were raids and fighting among tribes
Islam is often held up as changing things, but that is not necessarily the case in everything

there were a lot of things thought about how women were treated both pre and post Islam

There was an obsession in some ways with sex
Muhammad was said to be able to satisfy all of his wives (9 to 11) in a single night! (Sahih Bukhari - Volume 1, Book 5, Number 268)
Paradise is billed as a place filled with sexual benefits by having many wives or virgins which never grow old
Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 72, Number 717 -> illegal sexual intercourse and theft does not get in the way of access to paradise
This appears to be a situation where sexualization is being legitimized, because it is so popular in the culture
There are other Hadith statements that support this position as well

Extramarital intercourse was very common among Arabs in pre-Islamic Arabia
Islamic tradition says:
- Fathers were commonly upset by daughters being born to them rather than sons in pre-Islamic times (stated by Islamic sources, see Q 16:58-59 && 81:8-9)
- We do not have evidence that this anti-girl belief set was real
Arabs practiced many kinds of marriage
- temporary (pleasure marriage/sex - muta) && Muta continues into Islam
- - Marriage lasts for a period (days maybe) and then be annulled after a payment (a.k.a. prostitution)
- within a family
- Concubines (marriage by purchase)
- Slaves
- Marriage by agreement (aristocrats)
Read the entry about temporary marriages in the encyclopedia of the Qur'an
Islam desires for us to believe that Islam has changed everything, but these things continue on to this day
See Misyar (on-the-go marriage for short periods - practiced today)
There is very little support for the idea that Islam has changed a great deal of the culture that it exists in

There were strong women before Islam (see Khadija as an example)
Khadija even initiates the marriage proposal to Muhammad not the other way around
the wife of Abu Sufyan (Muhammad's opponent) was also politically active according to Muslim texts
Khadija had a business, and wealth, and initiated a marriage proposal - all things that Islamic sources would say women did not have prior to Islam
So there is no support for the position that women had few rights prior to Islam

Women are still treated badly even to today
Previously it was emphasized that men would not lose any benefits as long as they proclaimed Allah is one -- even if they abused the women and others around them
This still continues today in how the culture emphasizes men as the dominant and important members of society
