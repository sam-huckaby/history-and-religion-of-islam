# Week One Notes

## Lecture 1
We will be exploring major spots in the history of Islam
We understand the importance of history.
Our goal is to be able to present the Gospel to Muslims well and in a way that they will be able to understand and appreciate.

It sounds like there is a second course "Texts of Islam" that I have not taken, so here's hoping I am not missing too much.
Texts of Islam explores lots of texts, like the Hadith and the Qur'an and how they shape Islam

This course will instead be a history of Islam's inception through mideival and even as far forward as ISIS and the Golden Caliphate.
Focusing mostly on Islamic texts found in the Qur'an and Islamic history found in the life of Muhammad.

### Class goals
Our goal is to be able to have fruitful conversations with Muslims
Muslims (like any person of faith) tend to portray their history and development in the best possible terms
To suggest that there are flaws in their history is to suggest that Allah is no leading and guiding them, or that they have lost their way.

The textbook for the course is essentially the encyclopedia of the Qur'an
We are not reading an entire encyclopedia, but we are being given a chance to excel in our Islamic studies, because we can be as broad and deep as we want.

We should (by the end of this course) be much better informed about Islam than the average American (which doesn't seem super hard, tbh)

We are also learning from a reader on classical Islam. We need to interact with as many primary sources as possible, though they will be translated into English from Arabic.
We will study some of the Serah (sp?) which is Muhammad's biography (primary source #1)
We will also study the origins of the Islamic State (Primary source #2)
- This will take on the history of Islam in the three caliphates that came after Muhammad's death

This course has a double focus
- Study of the history and development of Islam from its origins to the modern day
- - to study Muhammad's life and and his conquests and raids
- - to learn about the caliphates that led Islam in the years following Muhammad's death
- We also want to learn how to proclaim the Gospel of Christ to our Muslim neighbors as well, in a way that is accurate and empathetic

### How should Christians go about studying Islam?
It is very important to understand the difference between Islam and Muslims
- Islam is a faith, religion, ideology
- - I can critique and question these things
- - I can learn about them and understand them, but not accept them
- Muslims are people, just like you or I
- - These are image bearers like myself
- - I am called to love Muslims as Christ loves me
- - These are our neighors, we must care about them
- - We must NOT seek out Muslims JUST to convert them
- - We must love and live with our neighbors, and know that through our lives we will each inform the other about our belliefs

There are Basically Four approaches to studying Islam
- Polemical approach
- - Demonizing anything at all around the entitiy of Islam
- - Attacking Islam, the worldviews and ideas
- - Attacking Muslims verbally or otherwise
- - Leaves nothing to be liked in Islam
- - This approach builds NO bridges, and it does NOT help any Muslim
- - Making a caricature out of Muhammad or Muslims does nothing other than harm people and burn your own bridges
- - Sometimes Christians in the middle east are exclusively polemic in their approach, and it does sometimes help a discussion where one might just be shut down and ignored, but it is not recommended
- Sympathetic approach
- - "Islam is so cool!"
- - Downplays any negatives about Islam (It's a logical religion, it provides for women's rights beyond what was known at the time)
- - Used heavily in media outlets that compare religions (especially against Christianity)
- - Not super helpful either, because it establishes no meaningful conversations with Muslims
- - Either view (polemic or sympathetic) makes Islam into a big monolithic religion that has no branches or denominations within it
- - This view tends to build a "Muhammad" that is just a good example for today, but does not follow the texts about Muuhammad

## Lecture 2
We do not go down the road of polemical or sympathetic approaches to study or discuss Islam
"To love Muhammad is to love Allah, and to love Allah is to love Muhammad. Whoever loves Muhammad will be loved by Allah, and whoever is loved by Allah will not have anything to worry about! And how can anyone not love Muhammad? Unless he is sick in the head or the heart."
^^ Notice how much this sounds American-ized, how it smacks almost of prosperity gospel preaching?

How should Christians go about studying Islam (part 2)
- The Critical Approach
- - how Islam is studied in the academy
- - "There is no evidence for Muhammad, so Muhammad never existed probably" -example
- - An example, Patricia Crony, argues that the bulk of Islamic history is debris of an obliterated past
- - She argues that the real history of Muhammad is unreachable, and cannot be known
- - This is a point worth noting because the foudnational sources we have about Muhammad and his life come from 200 years after his life
- - (This is not including footnotes in history that briefly mention his name or an Arabian conquerer)
- - Crony argues that we cannot accept the story put forth in Islamic texts because they come from too far after
- - Fred Donner is more sympathetic
- - Donner believes that Islam began with a community of "Believers" and not necessarily a unique religion as Islam
- - Islam came later, beginning first as a monotheist preacher who was seeking to gether those who believed in one true god
- - Sunnis would say the Qur'an is solid and was compiled within 20 years of Muhammads death
- - Shiites would say "no" Muhammad approved the original written text in his lifetime.
- - Yehuda Nivo - basis his studies primarily on archaeology and nothing that cannot be found in the archaeological record is valid
- - ^^ This person would say there is no evidence for Muhammad's actual existence
- - All of these approaches are confusing and conflicting, but they are all legitimate arguments because of how poor the sources are in the early stage of Islam

- The Critical Theological Approach
- - What does the Bible say about this topic?
- - How can we use the lens of the Bible to inform our discussions?
- - Critiquing something without providing a source of truth is useless
- - "We cannot call Muhammad a Christian prophet, because 1 John tells us that whoever denies Jesus is God is antichrist."
- - Take anything from the Critical Approach, but answer the questions using the Bible, rather than via guesses
- - See Muslims through the lens of the cross, as a people that God Himself loves and seeks out, just as He sought out you and I
- - Jesus said we were called to proclaim the truth, freedom from captivity to even their ideology, and to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor to all those held in captivity by Satan and sin
- - Eight aspects
- - - Christ-centered
- - - - not to dispise Muhammad for Muslims, but to elevate Jesus and be Christ-centered.
- - - - Bring the hope of Jesus to a people that want to love God and have hope
- - - Evangelistic and Scholarly honest
- - - - I want to tell Muslims about the God I actually love
- - - - I absolutely do not want to lie or trick someone about Islam, because we are never called to be liars
- - - - If I cannot prove something I believe about Islam, I will not discuss it with a Muslim
- - - Passionate about God's mission in the world
- - - - If we are not passionate about God's work, then the church does not work
- - - - A church that does not go out to spread God's word will simply FIGHT ITSELF
- - - Intentional about witness for the Gospel
- - - - Discussion around the end times is always a good bridge to discuss with Muslims, because we are both curious and interested in that topic
- - - - We must ALWAYS present the Gospel of HOPE
- - - Respectful of Muslims
- - - - Some Muslims are just nominal, simply born into that context (like some Christians)
- - - Acknowledge the diversity among Muslims
- - - - The beliefs are diverse and varied across the landscape
- - - Loving of all
- - - Friendly to people who are different

The Critical Approach is good, but not satisfactory.
We must be bringing answers and not just tearing things down without something to heal and build in its place

Adopt the Critical Theological approach

Many of the challenges we will approach next will be with the sources and the nature of their history

# Lecture 3

We must follow the Critical Theological approach and be loving to Muslims while being scholarly critical of Islam

In this course we will focus on the texts that tell us the history of Islam

We must recognize that we are beginning from a position of "being shocked"
why? Because almost all of these texts will not be contemporary to Muhammad.
Our problem is that Muhammad lived 570-632 AD, but during thie period we have NO written record about his life
Jesus had much written about him, and especially by people who didn't like Him.
One set of texts (in Islam) written about their prophet
A second set of texts written about some guy who appeared among the Arabs

- The Muslim sources are developed centuries after Muhammad
- The Muslim sources are designed to elevate Muhammad
BUT
- Non-Muslim sources say almost nothing about Muhammad
- Non-Muslim sources are incredibly few and rare
- almost no details comes from non-Muslim sources

Muslims viewed Muhammad positively (bias)
Non-Muslims view Muhammad negatively (bias)

There were some attempts to write about Muhammad from Muslim sources 70ish years after his death, but we don't have those sources
Everything we are able to learn about Muhammad comes centuries after his life.
Recall that Crony said "The bulk of Muslim history is gone - debris of an obliterated past"
This is our challenge: We have no solid sources
Even major Muslim historians complain that there are a lot of contradictory reports

We will look heavily at the three caliphates after Muhammad.
The first caliphate left us no written documents
The second caliphate had some historical documents, but they were very much antagonistic (and were opposed to the part of the family that ruled in the first caliphate)
The third caliphate was rivals to the second caliphate and they obliterated most of the records from the second caliphate

Caliphates were using their control over the written record about Muhammad was used to legitimize their rule in one way or another
The sources provide us with a story that fits with the later period of Islam
In a way we have to view the shadows on the wall as much as the characters shown to us in front.

And example: Muhammad's biography (Serah)
Muhammad is the exemplar of how Muslims are to live their life
This biography came from the third caliphate
A person who was pro-caliph in that time was asked to write it
We don't have this biography - it was lost
50 years later, a "copy" was "found" but it was in a very different time politically
We know from other areas that the first biography was pro-shiite in some ways
The Shiites we no longer seen in a positive light, so the bioraphy was censored to be less pro-shiite
This kind of censoring happened often, and this is an important text for Muslims too (the biography)

The Qur'an
According to Shiite Muslims - Muhammad canonized it
According to Sunni Muslims - It took 20 years after Muhammad to be cannonized
According to Scholars - The written Qur'an took a couple centuries to be canonized because there was so much competing material

Example - The Qur'an proclaimed by Muhammad is identical to the Qur'an we have today (but this we have conflicting copies, which is a problem to this idea)
Surah 2:165-167 vs 168-169 vs 170
- The verses do not flow
- start with Allah's law and following
- Jumps to discussing some things about Satan
- jumps back to talking about following Allah.
- it appears that the verses were inserted into the wrong place

The Qur'an is not a history book, it does not disclose locations or details most of the time
So if the Qur'an is not a faithful reproduction of what Muhammad said today, what are they?
They are a political tool that was used often to persuade the people at that time to follow the current caliphate
But we must study and understand this, regardless of what we believe about it (the above or otherwise) because we love Muslims and THEY love the Qur'an
We must understand what Muslims believe to be able to have real discussions with them about their faith and ours.
We must connect with Muslims based on their own accounds and their own understanding of what they believe

If we are to argue that their accounts are not accurate, we must discuss the texts that they love, and do so lovingly
Muslims revere and admire this history, so we must at least understand it and be able to engage with it.
