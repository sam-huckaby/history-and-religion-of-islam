## Lecture 23

### Shiites and Sunnis: Distinguishing Ali's Supporters

- The Majority of Muslims are Sunni's - 85%
- Shiites make up about 13%
- Others make up the other 2%
- Sufi's are generally Sunni or Shiite, so they are not counted among the 2%
- Shiites and Sunnis did not necessarily split immediately after Muhammad's death
- Shi'ia were originally political supporters of Ali, not a separate denomination
- These were the supporters of Ali
- 100+ years later, they began to be distinguished religiously
- Shia literally means "party / followers"
- The Qur'an's use of this word generally applies as "factions or communities"
- Everything is realy contained in the Abdemanaf family tree:
- - Abdemanaf
- - - Abdeshams
- - - - Umayya
- - - - - Harb
- - - - - - Abu Sufyan
- - - Hashim
- - - - Abdulmuttalib
- - - - - Abdullah
- - - - - - Muhammad (s)
- Political struggles within Islam generally occur between these two branches of the family
- Abu Bakr was not in the tree, but he was succeeded by an Umayya descendant
- Umayya's side of the tree is the Sunnis
- Muhammad's side of the tree is the Shiites
- The Abbasiids restores the leadership to Muhammad's side of the tree
- Ali finally becoming Caliph was short-lived as civil war broke out
- Video that gives an example of the differences viewed by Shia and Sunni: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrzzEjUzs-Q
- The differences are far more than political, per the video above

#### Who was Mu'awiya?
- Son of Abu Sufyan (from Quraysh tribe)
- - Abu Sufyan was an early major opponent of Muhammad
- - One of the Tulaqaa' (converted strictly to save their own life)
- - These kinds of converts were essentially unconvinced about Islam and were simply submitting to Muhammad
- - They may not even have considered themselves as submitting to Allah at all, they were simply submitting to whomever would save their lives
- Cunning, worldly, materialistic, and lust ful for power
- Umar appointed Mu'awyia's brother, Yazid as the governor of Syria and then Mu'awiya became governor next
- Mu'awiya became a Muslim only around the conquest of Mecca
- Tulaqaa' are essentially despised, though the term means (those who are set free) because they were Muslims "by convenience"
- Much of Tulaqaa' faith is doubted
- Yazid dies of a disease after being appointed to Syria as governor when it was captured from the Byzantines
- Uthman will then appoint Mu'awiya as governor and he became so powerful that he was essentially the Syrian caliph
- Mu'awiya would leverage the great wealth of Syria to build loyalty among supporters and grant favors
- He also used this great wealth to build a network of informants against Ahl al-Bayt (the household of Muhammad) and their devotees
- Keep in mind that at this point there are still no clear distinctions between Sunni and Shiite Muslims

## Lecture 24

### The Battle of the Camel (Jamal Confrontation): Distinguishing Ali's Supporters
This is a continuation of the discussion of civil war(s) that led to the split between Shiites and Sunni

- Ali was against the "big three" (Aisha, Zubayr, Talha)
- Upon becoming the fourth Caliph, Ali decided to remove Mu'awiya as governor from Syria
- This created a problem because Mu'awiya was now against him, as well as the "Big Three"
- Mu'awiya would then rebel, no longer recognizing Ali's authority and starting a new government in Syria and leveled many accusations against Ali
- - Claimed that Ali killed Uthman
- - Incited people to fight against Ali
- Aisha also began working against Ali because she did not like him, and to seek revenge for Uthman's death
- Aisha raised a large group of fighters to attack Basra and killed 600 Muslims (Shiites - at this point simply politically allied with Ali)
- Ali could not sit back quietly, he marched to Basra to try and quell the rebels
- This led to a battle in which Zubayr chose not to fight, Aisha fell off her camel, and Talha bled to death)
- After the battle, Ali asked Aisha's brother to take her back to Medina with full honor and dignity
- Upon leaving Basra, Ali's two sons (al-Hasan and al-Husayn) !!!IMPORTANT NAMES!!! accompanied Aisha for some distance to be sure she was safe
- ^ This is mostly information from a Shiite perspective (thus Ali and his forces are pictured more favorably)
- Ali decides to forgive everyone who fought against him, much as Muhammad did after conquering Mecca
- The reason we want to look at Ali from a Shiite perspective is because a Sunni portrayal of Ali will almost always be negative

### The Battle of Siffin and the First Fitna
- Ali then returns to Kufa (the newest capital of the Islamic state) and begins preparing to fight Mu'awiya
- Ali moved the capital from Medina to Kufa because he did not have enough support in Medina
- Fitna => Civil war
- War lasts from 656 to 661
- Mu'awiya would win this civil war and become the next caliph
- Mu'awiya will often be referred to in negative terms in historical documents, but this is because history is written by the next caliphate normally
- The caliphate after Mu'Awiya did not like him and sought to discredit him
- The Battle of Siffin pitted Ali against Mu'awiya
- Siffin is the place where the battle took place
- The two camps fought for nine days
- Mu'awiya and his troops were about to collapse (shiia sources portray it this way)
- Mu'awiya then used (according to the Shiia) a dirty trick and used the Qur'an against his enemies
- Supposedly, he had 500 Qur'ans put on the tips of spears as a way to stun the troops of Ali
- This stopped the battle as it appeared to be a time to negotiate instead of fight
- Ali refused to fight when the Qur'an was called out to for negotiation
- Ali's supporters then turned against him because they wanted him to keep fighting
- Shia then say that Ali recognized the deceit quickly, but his troops would not do it
- There is a rumor that Amr Ibn al-As (Mu'Awiya's general) and Ash'ath Ibn Qays (Ali's general who was a double agent) worked against Ali
- Negotaiations did not start for at least a year after the battle stopped
- Ali chose Kufa's governer, al Ash'ari as his negotiator
- Mu'awiya chose Amr Ibn al-As, a cunning general
- Ash'ari suggested they hold a new election for caliphate
- the other guy suggested that he announce that first, and then he said he didn't agree and thought that Mu'awiya should be caliph, and deceived people
- Kharijies were the group that split off because they hated both possible Caliphs
- The Kharijies then attempt to assassinate all three (Ali, Mu'awiya, and Amr Ibn al-As) at the morning prayers
- Only Ali is killed, because only Ali actually went to morning prayers


## Lecture 25

### Al-Hasan and Mu'awiya: The Story Continues
- Most places that we read Islamic history will end up being Sunni accounts
- Sunnis make up 85% of Muslims
- We need to understand this, and read with this lens in mind
- These lectures will accentuate the Shiia accounts, because we should hear from both sides and will likely hear the other parts of the stories elsewhere
- Shiite literature is almost always in Arabic, (al-islam.org)[http://al-islam.org] is a useful resource though
- Hasan is considered the second Imam among Shia
- Hasan sought peace with Mu'awiya, which was a bad plan for all the obvious reasons
- Islam was in chaos, and much of the Islamic state was in conflict and disagreement
- Ahl al-Bayt (the people of the household of Muhammad) !!!IMPORTANT!!!
- Hasan was (according to Shia sources) the leader of the community
- Hasan offered peace to Mu'awiya, and it was accepted
- Five important terms of the agreement:
- - Amnesty to people of Syria, Iraq, Hijaz, and Yemen
- - Friends and companions of Ali and all their women and children are spared and protected
- - Mu'awiya is to cease the use of abusive language against Ahl al-Bayt
- - Hasan would become Caliph upon Mu'awiya's death
- - Mu'awiya would not appoint a successor
- Hasan and his brother moved back to Medina
- Mu'awiya continued to secretly kill Ahl al-Bayt
- Mu'awiya had to plan to murder Hasan
- Remember: Mu'awiya is almost always portrayed as bad, by both Sunni and Shia sources, because he was the first Umayyan caliph
- Mu'awiya wanted Yazid (his super immoral son) to be the next Caliph (both Sunni and Shia sources agree that Yazid was bad news)
- Mu'awiya therefore needed to kill Hasan
- Mu'awiya conspired with Joda (Hasan's wife) to poison him in return for a large sum of money and the chance to marry Yazid (wow, what a prize)
- Hasan realized things were not good and appointed Husayn his brother to be the next Imam
- Hasan wished to be buried next to Muhammad, but the governor of Medina would not allow it and used military force to stop Hasayn from burying him next to Muhammad
- Remember: Shia was JUST political support for Ali's side of the famliy tree at this point (not the religious branch we know today)
- Husayn was 46 years when he was designated as the third Imam
- According to shiites, Husayn continued to teach Islam for several years, even after Mu'awiya designated Yazid to succeed him
- Mu'awiya desired to move Islam into a monarchy-style governance
- Islam is supposed to be "Shura" (consultation)
- Muslims recognized that Yazid was terrible and rejected him, but Mu'awiya prevailed through his power and influence
- Mu'awiya sent agents to prominent members of the communities to exact allegance to Yazid
- The people (Muslims) protested heavily
- Mu'awiya sent his son on the Meccan pilgrimage, but Yazid brought girls and alcohol along with him
- When Mu'awiya died, Yazid was off on a "for fun" hunting trip
- Yazid became Caliph and used all the same tactics as his father (bribes, threats, deceit, etc)
- Husayn and his family did not give in and instead chose to challenge the Umayyads
- Yazid sent his governor to get Husayn's allegiance or be murdered
- Husayn fled to Mecca, and Kufa wrote him a bunch of letters (12,000 supposedly) from Kufa urging him to come be the true Caliph
- Husayn sent people to check things out in Iraq
- Yazid sent people to assassinate Husayn
- Husayn then began the long journey (against his friends and relatives advice) to Kufa in the heat of the summer. a 1,100 mile journey.
- This is the journey to Karbala
- This will becomes the most important story of heroism in Shia sources
- Camels travel roughly 30-45 miles per day
- The distance between Kufa nad Damascus (where Yazid was) is 750 miles
- Yazid can definitely get there first to prepare for battling Husayn


## Lecture 26

### Umayyan dynasty and Karbala (continued)
- Many Shia Muslims travel to Karbala as pilgrimage
- Many Shia do not want to go to Saudia Arabia (where Mecca is) because it is so pro-Sunni and anti-Shia
- Karbala is a completely Shia shrine
- al-Farazdaq (a famous poet) met Husayn on the road and warned him that while the people's hearts were with him, their swords would be against him and said he should not go to Kufa
- Husayn finally received a letter from his representative in Kufa with good news that people were more than ready to bring Husayn as an Imam
- Husayn sent another envoy to Kufa to check further
- Husayn's supporters continued to meet in Kufa
- Yazid found out about the meetings with Husayn's supporters and so he got rid of that governor and replaced him with someone loyal to himself (Ubaydullah)
- Ubaydullah then beheaded two key supporters of Husayn
- Husayn found out this had happened when he was quite close to Kufa and told his followers that they could leave if they wanted and he would not hold it against them
- Husayn continued his journey until he came face-to-face with 1,000 horsemen from Yazid
- Husayn did not want to fight, and showed the commander the letters he received from Kufa
- The army's commander said that he must take Husayn to Ubaydullah (the governor)
- Husayn accepted and marched with the army towards Yazid
- Husayn was honorable and honest and treated people very well
- Yazid then sent and commanded the commander to force Husayn to halt in a dry place with no vegetation, in order to starve them
- The army commander showed the letter to Husayn, and so Husayn and his people continued on until they were stopped by another military force
- This new place was Karbala in A.H. 61 (681 C.E. - almost 50 years after Muhammad's death)
- !!! Karbala is very important !!!
- Karbala is the defining event in Shiism
- Husayn was martyred along with his male family members and many companions in 681 by the Umayyads
- This was sort of a good vs evil sort of situation in Islamic history and is painted that way by many Islamic sources
- Husayn's martyrdom is still celebrated today, and here is a video that sort of gives a picture of it: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgnEtaAEx24)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgnEtaAEx24]
- Searching for Ashura in Karbala will also give you a good idea of this kind of rememberance of Husayn
- Husayn was violently beaten and ultimately murdered at Karbala
- Karbala would become a defining moment in the Shia-Sunni split

### The battle of Karbala
- The battle took place in A.H. 61 in Karbala, in present day Iraq
- It was between a small group of Musayn's supporters and relatives and Yazid's much larger force
- According to Shia, Husayn was a representative of Muhammad that sought to safeguard Islam while Yazid and the government just sought to control power by force
- - Shiites say that Ali had to fight Mu'awiya to safeguard Islam
- - al-Hasan had to make peace solely to protect Islam
- Yazid's force surrounded Husayn's camp and cut off water and other necessities
- This was Alids vs Umayyads (not Sunni vs Shia)
- Shia Muslims value Karbala as a symbol of heroism
- Yazid succeeded in surrounding Husayn's camp
- The upcoming section is very important for understanding the Shiite anger towards Sunni Islam


## Lecture 27

### The Battle of Karbala
- Kufa governor and his army succeed in laying siege around Husayn's camp
- The army's leader (Ibn Sa'd) liked Husayn because he talked to him and convinced him to let Husayn leave Iraq
- The Kufa governor however refused the proposal under the opposition of another person
- Ibn Sa'd was given an ultimatum: Either fight Husayn or be killed
- Ibn Sa'd decided to fight Husayn and cut off all access to water for them
- Husayn is recorded as offering everyone else to go home since they only wanted him, but his troops would not leave him
- No water and their sick piling up was problematic
- According to tradition, Husayn went out and saw Ibn Sa'd preparing to mobilize his troops and he prayed a prayer similar to many biblical Old Testament prophets
- Husayn's supporters insisted on starting the fight themselves
- Sa'd's troops were ordered to set fire to the tents of Ahl al-Bayt, which was mostly women and children
- Ali Akbar (Husayn's firstborn son) got permission to fight next to his father
- Ali Akbar was covered in sword and spear cuts until he was just covered in gushing wounds and he died
- According to Shia sources, all of these fighters stood bravely and believed in Husayn, showing their faith and acceptance of martyrdom
- This day is remembered as the day of Ashura in Shia tradition
- For an example of the way this martyrdom is viewed even today, watch this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v61rpKZ6oL8)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v61rpKZ6oL8]
- Husayn saw all of his loved ones being killed
- He heard his 6-month-old baby's death by arrows from the enemy
- Husayn then fought on alone, receiving many wounds in the process
- Husayn lost feeling in his body as he fell, and when trying to stand up by leaning on his sword he received the final blow
- The army's leader came forward and beheaded Husayn and sent his head to Yazid
- Ibn Sa'd took the women and children and carried them off as plunder led away by the heads of Husayn and his supporters on spears at the front of the caravan
- This was an awful situation and a brutal slaughter of Muslims by Muslims
- For a Sunni point of view on this same situation, watch this video: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekgYVM1lun8)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekgYVM1lun8]
- There are three main branches of Shias today:
- - The Zaydis
- - - Followers of Zayd ibn Ali ibn al-Husayn
- - - Believe that the Imam ought to fight for his rights and be a ruler of state
- - The Ismailis (Seveners)
- - - Named after the seventh imam, Ismail
- - - Founded the Fatimid Empire (909 - 1171)
- - - Represent esoteric Shiism
- - The Ithna Asharis (Twelvers or Imamis)
- - - The largest and most moderate group
- - - They believe in twelve Imams and ending with Muhammad al-Mahdi
- - - This last imam went into occultation (and is still presently alive, by their tradition)
- Historically the Shias enjoyed the most favorable conditions under the Buyid dynasty rule (945 - 1055)
- This is when the major collections of Shia hadith were compiled and Shia legal thought was formulated 
- Two popular Shia commemorations were instituted in Baghdad at this time:
- - The rememberance of Husayn's martyrdom
- - The Festival of Ghadir Khumm (Muhammad's nomination of Ali as his successor)
