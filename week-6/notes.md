### Shiites and Sunnis: Distinguishing Ali's Supporters

- The Majority of Muslims are Sunni's - 85%
- Shiites make up about 13%
- Others make up the other 2%
- Sufi's are generally Sunni or Shiite, so they are not counted among the 2%
- Shiites and Sunnis did not necessarily split immediately after Muhammad's death
- Shi'ia were originally political supporters of Ali, not a separate denomination
- These were the supporters of Ali
- 100+ years later, they began to be distinguished religiously
- Shia literally means "party / followers"
- The Qur'an's use of this word generally applies as "factions or communities"
- Everything is realy contained in the Abdemanaf family tree:
- - Abdemanaf
- - - Abdeshams
- - - - Umayya
- - - - - Harb
- - - - - - Abu Sufyan
- - - Hashim
- - - - Abdulmuttalib
- - - - - Abdullah
- - - - - - Muhammad (s)
- Political struggles within Islam generally occur between these two branches of the family
- Abu Bakr was not in the tree, but he was succeeded by an Umayya descendant
- Umayya's side of the tree is the Sunnis
- Muhammad's side of the tree is the Shiites
- The Abbasiids restores the leadership to Muhammad's side of the tree
- Ali finally becoming Caliph was short-lived as civil war broke out
- Video that gives an example of the differences viewed by Shia and Sunni: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrzzEjUzs-Q
- The differences are far more than political, per the video above

#### Who was Mu'awiya?
- Son of Abu Sufyan (from Quraysh tribe)
- - Abu Sufyan was an early major opponent of Muhammad
- - One of the Tulaqaa' (converted strictly to save their own life)
- - These kinds of converts were essentially unconvinced about Islam and were simply submitting to Muhammad
- - They may not even have considered themselves as submitting to Allah at all, they were simply submitting to whomever would save their lives
- Cunning, worldly, materialistic, and lust ful for power
- Umar appointed Mu'awyia's brother, Yazid as the governor of Syria and then Mu'awiya became governor next
- Mu'awiya became a Muslim only around the conquest of Mecca
- Tulaqaa' are essentially despised, though the term means (those who are set free) because they were Muslims "by convenience"
- Much of Tulaqaa' faith is doubted
- Yazid dies of a disease after being appointed to Syria as governor when it was captured from the Byzantines
- Uthman will then appoint Mu'awiya as governor and he became so powerful that he was essentially the Syrian caliph
- Mu'awiya would leverage the great wealth of Syria to build loyalty among supporters and grant favors
- He also used this great wealth to build a network of informants against Ahl al-Bayt (the household of Muhammad) and their devotees
- Keep in mind that at this point there are still no clear distinctions between Sunni and Shiite Muslims
