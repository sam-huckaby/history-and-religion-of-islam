## Lecture 28

### Umayyad Caliphate/Dynasty

- The second caliphate
- The founder of this dynastic was Mu'awiya, the son of Abu Sufyan
- Abu Sufyan was Muhammad's enemy during the majority of (or possibly all of) Muhammad's life
- When we look at the battles within Islam, we need to remember that this is a tribal fight
- - One half of the tree (Muhammad's half) came from Hashim
- - One half came from Abdeshams and later the Umayyads
- - Ali came from Hashim, Mu'awiya came from Umayyads
- The Umayyads were a largely Merchant family of the Quraysh tribe centered at Mecca
- They initially resisted Islam until 627
- The Umayyad Caliphate/Dynasty ruled from the death of the fourth Caliph (Sunni) or first Imam (Shia) in 661 until 750
- They were referred to as "The Arab Kingdom" which met disapproval from Muslims, because it was "Arabs" over "Muslims"
- - Muslims were sort of a second class citizen in this kingdom
- - It was Arab first
- After the first Muslim civil war (with Ali), Mu'awiya victoriously established himself as the first Umayyad caliph
- The Abassyds would consider themself as an Islamic Caliphate, rather than an Arab Kingdom
- The Abassyds were eager to paint themselves as pious though, so this fact must be taken with a grain of salt
- Mu'awiya's family was known to be materialistic, worldly, and lustful for power (or at least this is what we hear from the Abassyds - could still be true)
- Mu'awiya did not become a Muslim until around/after the conquest of Mecca
- It is important to note that all Muslims who converted at or after the conquest of Mecca were viewed us untrustworthy and liars
- These "Muslims" got a special name: Tulaqaa'
- Remember that much of this information comes from the Abassyds, who were seeking to paint themselves as righteous and true Muslims
- Mu'awiya's immediate family were Tulaqaa'
- Mu'awiya became governor of Syria when his brother Yazid died of a disease
- Mu'awiya built a large base of support, to an almost fanatical level
- Mu'awiya spent a lot of time fighting to put down Shiite (Ali supporting, not a religious group realy) supporters
- Mu'awiya would later (sometime before 680) establish Damascus as the capital of the caliphate
- The second most important Caliph after Mu'awiya was Abd al-Malik
- Abd al-Malik made Arabic the main language of the caliphate and replaced coinage with ones that contained Arabic

### Abd al-Malik
- Came to power in 685
- He ordered the construction of the Dome of the Rock
- He was more autocratic than Mu'awiya
- He is often compared to Mu'awiya
- Got rid of the council of advisors that had been used previously and reserved major decisions for himself
- It is said by some that Islam was solidified as a religion under Abd al-Malik because of the inscriptions in the Dome of the Rock
- He was a master politician, regardless of his religious leanings
- Governor Hajej (sp?) burned Qur'ans and had his own copies distributed (during Abd al-Malik's reign..?)
- Dome of the Rock is the oldest extant Islamic monument
- The rock it sits on is sacred to both Muslims and Jews
- Muhammad is traditionally believed to have ascended to heaven from this site
- To the Jews, it is traditional to believe that this is where Abraham prepared to sacrifice Isaac


## Lecture 29

### Abd al-Malik (continued)
- Both the Dome of the ROck and Al-Aqsa Mosque are located on the Temple Mount, the site of Solomon's Temple and its successors (an area known to Muslims as Al-Haram al-Sharif)
- An inscription in the Dome of the Rock establishes its date of completion as 691-692 some 55 years after Muslim armies captured Jerusalem
- We do not know the original function of the Dome of the Rock, it is uncertain
- The building is not a mosque and does not fit into other Islamic religious structure categories
- Some Christians and Muslims in the middle ages believed the Dome of the Rock to be Solomon's Temple
- Some traditions believe that Abd al-Malik built the Dome to proclaim the emergence of Islam as a supreme new faith
- Some of the inscriptions inside denounce the Trinity and disavow Jesus' deity while calling out the unity of Allah and Affirming Jesus as a prophet
- These inscriptions seem to really be trying to separate Islam from Christian views
- The Umayyads are not viewed very favorably, except for one caliph: Umar II (Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz)

### Umar II
- Born 682, died in 720
- reigned from 717 to 720
- He was very pious and respected and attempted to preserve the integrity of the Muslim Umayyad caliphate
- He emphasized religion and a return to the original Principles of Islam
- Some people even call him "the fifth Rashidi caliphate" because he is so highly regarded
- His father was the governor of Egypt and was descended from Umar I (second caliph)
- in 706 he was appointed governor of the Hijaz
- Creates a body of advisors from wise men
- At the beginning of his reign, the caliphate was threatened by the Mawali (non-Arab Muslims) and from pious Muslims who felt the Umayyads were putting political interests ahead of religious principles
- Umar II did not attempt any major military conquests, and even broke the siege of Constantinople (Istanbul now)
- Umar II spent much of his time and energy trying to stop the disintegration of the Umayyad caliphate by way of unorthodox but effect work to make life better for the people
- He dismissed bad governors and granted the Mawali the same fiscal rights as Arabs Musllims

### The Umayyads' Fall
- The "Arab Kingdom" was why the influence of the Mawali was growing
- growing friction between Arabs and non-Arabs
- The Abassids were slowly begin to rise and push for the return to Islamic
- The Umayyads conquered their way into Southern France
- Until they met defeat by Charles Martel in 732
- France stopped their advance at Poitiers (732)
- Arab forces were also destroyed in Anatolia (740)
- The Turks (Asia) and Berbers were also beginning to be a challenge
- They expanded into Central Asia and NorthWest India
- Conversion to Islam was actually discouraged in much of this conquest, because they wanted to tax people as non-Muslims
- There was a lot less killing than is sometimes portrayed, because they wanted the taxes. It was political, not religiously motivated conquest most of the time
- The armies were originally exclusively Arab and Muslim, but Mawali (clients) were ultimately included mostly of Iranian and Berber origin
- Later Muslim historians accused the Umayyads of transforming the Islamic state into an Arab kingdom
- Abassids would overthrow them in 750
- A religio-political sect, The Hashimiyah, grew in Kufa (a Shia / Ali-supporting city)
- in 749, the Hashimiyah proclaimed Abu al-Abbas al Saffah as Caliphate, the first Abbasid caliph
- The Hashimiyah was a movement of Supporters of Ali (Shia) that grew in the Iraqi city of Kufa
- They believed in the successive Imams of the Abbasid famliy
- Ibrahim the Imam worked to stir up anti-Umayyad sentiment among moderate Shia and Mawali converts to Islam
- They (Hashimiyah) created Propaganda against the Umayyads, acting as a sort of missionary branch
- by 747 Hashimiyah had assumed a military character, and was able to take the city of Merv, then all of Khurasan, then to Rayy, Nahavand, and finally Kufa in 749
- The Hashimiyah armies installed Abu al-Abbas al-Saffah as Abbasid caliph in Kufah in 749
- Saffah defeated the last Umayyad, Marwan II at the battle of the Great Zab River in 750
- At this point the Abbasid victory was complete
- Islam as we know it today has come to us largely through the Abbasid caliphate, and so we turn there next


## Lecture 30

### Abbasid Caliphate, Empire, or Dynasty (the third caliphate)
- Arguably the most important caliphate of the first three, because almost all of what we know about Islam comes from this Caliphate
- The Abbasid Dynasty is the second of the two great dynasties of the Muslim Empire of the Caliphate
- It overthrew the Umayyad Caliphate in 750
- It reigned until the Mongol invasion in 1258
- Abu al Abbas (The Blood Shedder) the brutal forefather of the Abbasids
- Al-Abbas is Muhammad's Uncle, much like Abu Talib (Ali's father) was
- Much dispute within Islam is NOT Shiite/Sunni as much as it is a struggle within the same family for power
- The Abbasids claimed the caliphate via their family relationship with Muhammad
- The distinguished themselves from prior caliphates by claiming they were more Muslim (vs the Arab Kingdom of the Umayyads)
- Abbasid leaders would give themselves new names, to point to how Allah was guiding and working in their individual lives
- Starting around 718, members of the Abbas family began building support to gain control of the empire (especially from Shia Arabs and Persians)
- Open revolt in 747 under the leadership of Abu Muslim ultimately led to the defeat of Marwan II
- The first Abbasid Caliph al-Saffah replaced Marwan II in 749
- The Surviving members of the Umayyad family fled to Spain where they ruled the Islamic West for the next six centuries
- Abbasids controlled central and eastern Islamic lands
- The Abbasids claimed to restore a truly Muslim government
- They focused much more heavily on moving Eastward
- They moved the capital to the new city of Baghdad
- In Egypt, North Africa, Spain, and elsewhere, local dynasties began to claim caliphal status.
- - This was local rulers who were sort of coming to power within the Abbasid dynasty
- - This groups were under the umbrella of the Abbasid dynasty originally but they began to sort of break off to solidify their own local power
- The Abbasid caliphate became more international, and it became more about being Muslim than being Arab

### The Abbasids Rise
- Pious Muslims supporters pushed the Abbasids to acknowledge the slowly refining Islamic law
- 750-833 saw a rise in the Abbasid power

### The Abbasids Decline
- al-Mu'tasim began to introduce foreign (Berber, Slav, and Turkish) which were not originally Muslim (though they "converted")
- This still began to shatter the unity built around a shared religion

### The Abbasids
- Some of the most famous caliphs in history were Abbasids (al-Rashid and al-Ma'mun)
- Later practices that would become mainstream were founded in the Abbasid Dynasty, such as slave armies

### The Golden Age (775-861)
- The golden age was up until 833
- This was when the power was being created and solidified
- The capital moved from Damascus to Baghdad
- This was done to be closer to Persia where the Mawali supporter base was located (those who helped overthrow the Umayyads)
- Baghdad was centrally located between Europe and Asia and was important for trade
- Scholars living in Baghdad translated Greek texts and made scientific discoveries
- This is the period when most of our current Islamic religious writings were originally penned
- This is when the Hadith, Sira, and Maghazi were written
- Christians and Jews actually helped with the great translations from Greek to Arabic
- Baghdad was a center for thinkers and philosophers
- in 756, Al-Mansur sent some 4,000 Arab mercenaries to assist the Chinese Tang dynasty in the An Shi Rebellion against An Lushan
- The Abbasides or "Black Flags" are noted in the Tang dynasty chronicles as the black robed Tazi (a persion term for Arab)
- The Abbasids are usually connected with black flags while Shiites are connected with green flags
- Al-Rashid sent embassies to China to help in war. They had a good relation with them.
