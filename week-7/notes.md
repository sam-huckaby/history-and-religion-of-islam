## Lecture 28

### Umayyad Caliphate/Dynasty

- The second caliphate
- The founder of this dynastic was Mu'awiya, the son of Abu Sufyan
- Abu Sufyan was Muhammad's enemy during the majority of (or possibly all of) Muhammad's life
- When we look at the battles within Islam, we need to remember that this is a tribal fight
- - One half of the tree (Muhammad's half) came from Hashim
- - One half came from Abdeshams and later the Umayyads
- - Ali came from Hashim, Mu'awiya came from Umayyads
- The Umayyads were a largely Merchant family of the Quraysh tribe centered at Mecca
- They initially resisted Islam until 627
- The Umayyad Caliphate/Dynasty ruled from the death of the fourth Caliph (Sunni) or first Imam (Shia) in 661 until 750
- They were referred to as "The Arab Kingdom" which met disapproval from Muslims, because it was "Arabs" over "Muslims"
- - Muslims were sort of a second class citizen in this kingdom
- - It was Arab first
- After the first Muslim civil war (with Ali), Mu'awiya victoriously established himself as the first Umayyad caliph
- The Abassyds would consider themself as an Islamic Caliphate, rather than an Arab Kingdom
- The Abassyds were eager to paint themselves as pious though, so this fact must be taken with a grain of salt
- Mu'awiya's family was known to be materialistic, worldly, and lustful for power (or at least this is what we hear from the Abassyds - could still be true)
- Mu'awiya did not become a Muslim until around/after the conquest of Mecca
- It is important to note that all Muslims who converted at or after the conquest of Mecca were viewed us untrustworthy and liars
- These "Muslims" got a special name: Tulaqaa'
- Remember that much of this information comes from the Abassyds, who were seeking to paint themselves as righteous and true Muslims
- Mu'awiya's immediate family were Tulaqaa'
- Mu'awiya became governor of Syria when his brother Yazid died of a disease
- Mu'awiya built a large base of support, to an almost fanatical level
- Mu'awiya spent a lot of time fighting to put down Shiite (Ali supporting, not a religious group realy) supporters
- Mu'awiya would later (sometime before 680) establish Damascus as the capital of the caliphate
- The second most important Caliph after Mu'awiya was Abd al-Malik
- Abd al-Malik made Arabic the main language of the caliphate and replaced coinage with ones that contained Arabic

### Abd al-Malik
- Came to power in 685
- He ordered the construction of the Dome of the Rock
- He was more autocratic than Mu'awiya
- He is often compared to Mu'awiya
- Got rid of the council of advisors that had been used previously and reserved major decisions for himself
- It is said by some that Islam was solidified as a religion under Abd al-Malik because of the inscriptions in the Dome of the Rock
- He was a master politician, regardless of his religious leanings
- Governor Hajej (sp?) burned Qur'ans and had his own copies distributed (during Abd al-Malik's reign..?)
- Dome of the Rock is the oldest extant Islamic monument
- The rock it sits on is sacred to both Muslims and Jews
- Muhammad is traditionally believed to have ascended to heaven from this site
- To the Jews, it is traditional to believe that this is where Abraham prepared to sacrifice Isaac


## Lecture 29

### Abd al-Malik (continued)
- Both the Dome of the ROck and Al-Aqsa Mosque are located on the Temple Mount, the site of Solomon's Temple and its successors (an area known to Muslims as Al-Haram al-Sharif)
- An inscription in the Dome of the Rock establishes its date of completion as 691-692 some 55 years after Muslim armies captured Jerusalem
- We do not know the original function of the Dome of the Rock, it is uncertain
- The building is not a mosque and does not fit into other Islamic religious structure categories
- Some Christians and Muslims in the middle ages believed the Dome of the Rock to be Solomon's Temple
- Some traditions believe that Abd al-Malik built the Dome to proclaim the emergence of Islam as a supreme new faith
- Some of the inscriptions inside denounce the Trinity and disavow Jesus' deity while calling out the unity of Allah and Affirming Jesus as a prophet
- These inscriptions seem to really be trying to separate Islam from Christian views
- The Umayyads are not viewed very favorably, except for one caliph: Umar II (Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz)

### Umar II
- Born 682, died in 720
- reigned from 717 to 720
- He was very pious and respected and attempted to preserve the integrity of the Muslim Umayyad caliphate
- He emphasized religion and a return to the original Principles of Islam
- Some people even call him "the fifth Rashidi caliphate" because he is so highly regarded
- His father was the governor of Egypt and was descended from Umar I (second caliph)
- in 706 he was appointed governor of the Hijaz
- Creates a body of advisors from wise men
- At the beginning of his reign, the caliphate was threatened by the Mawali (non-Arab Muslims) and from pious Muslims who felt the Umayyads were putting political interests ahead of religious principles
- Umar II did not attempt any major military conquests, and even broke the siege of Constantinople (Istanbul now)
- Umar II spent much of his time and energy trying to stop the disintegration of the Umayyad caliphate by way of unorthodox but effect work to make life better for the people
- He dismissed bad governors and granted the Mawali the same fiscal rights as Arabs Musllims

### The Umayyads' Fall
- The "Arab Kingdom" was why the influence of the Mawali was growing
- growing friction between Arabs and non-Arabs
- The Abassids were slowly begin to rise and push for the return to Islamic
- The Umayyads conquered their way into Southern France
- Until they met defeat by Charles Martel in 732
- France stopped their advance at Poitiers (732)
- Arab forces were also destroyed in Anatolia (740)
- The Turks (Asia) and Berbers were also beginning to be a challenge
- They expanded into Central Asia and NorthWest India
- Conversion to Islam was actually discouraged in much of this conquest, because they wanted to tax people as non-Muslims
- There was a lot less killing than is sometimes portrayed, because they wanted the taxes. It was political, not religiously motivated conquest most of the time
- The armies were originally exclusively Arab and Muslim, but Mawali (clients) were ultimately included mostly of Iranian and Berber origin
- Later Muslim historians accused the Umayyads of transforming the Islamic state into an Arab kingdom
- Abassids would overthrow them in 750
- A religio-political sect, The Hashimiyah, grew in Kufa (a Shia / Ali-supporting city)
- in 749, the Hashimiyah proclaimed Abu al-Abbas al Saffah as Caliphate, the first Abbasid caliph
- The Hashimiyah was a movement of Supporters of Ali (Shia) that grew in the Iraqi city of Kufa
- They believed in the successive Imams of the Abbasid famliy
- Ibrahim the Imam worked to stir up anti-Umayyad sentiment among moderate Shia and Mawali converts to Islam
- They (Hashimiyah) created Propaganda against the Umayyads, acting as a sort of missionary branch
- by 747 Hashimiyah had assumed a military character, and was able to take the city of Merv, then all of Khurasan, then to Rayy, Nahavand, and finally Kufa in 749
- The Hashimiyah armies installed Abu al-Abbas al-Saffah as Abbasid caliph in Kufah in 749
- Saffah defeated the last Umayyad, Marwan II at the battle of the Great Zab River in 750
- At this point the Abbasid victory was complete
- Islam as we know it today has come to us largely through the Abbasid caliphate, and so we turn there next


## Lecture 30

### Abbasid Caliphate, Empire, or Dynasty (the third caliphate)
- Arguably the most important caliphate of the first three, because almost all of what we know about Islam comes from this Caliphate
- The Abbasid Dynasty is the second of the two great dynasties of the Muslim Empire of the Caliphate
- It overthrew the Umayyad Caliphate in 750
- It reigned until the Mongol invasion in 1258
- Abu al Abbas (The Blood Shedder) the brutal forefather of the Abbasids
- Al-Abbas is Muhammad's Uncle, much like Abu Talib (Ali's father) was
- Much dispute within Islam is NOT Shiite/Sunni as much as it is a struggle within the same family for power
- The Abbasids claimed the caliphate via their family relationship with Muhammad
- The distinguished themselves from prior caliphates by claiming they were more Muslim (vs the Arab Kingdom of the Umayyads)
- Abbasid leaders would give themselves new names, to point to how Allah was guiding and working in their individual lives
- Starting around 718, members of the Abbas family began building support to gain control of the empire (especially from Shia Arabs and Persians)
- Open revolt in 747 under the leadership of Abu Muslim ultimately led to the defeat of Marwan II
- The first Abbasid Caliph al-Saffah replaced Marwan II in 749
- The Surviving members of the Umayyad family fled to Spain where they ruled the Islamic West for the next six centuries
- Abbasids controlled central and eastern Islamic lands
- The Abbasids claimed to restore a truly Muslim government
- They focused much more heavily on moving Eastward
- They moved the capital to the new city of Baghdad
- In Egypt, North Africa, Spain, and elsewhere, local dynasties began to claim caliphal status.
- - This was local rulers who were sort of coming to power within the Abbasid dynasty
- - This groups were under the umbrella of the Abbasid dynasty originally but they began to sort of break off to solidify their own local power
- The Abbasid caliphate became more international, and it became more about being Muslim than being Arab

### The Abbasids Rise
- Pious Muslims supporters pushed the Abbasids to acknowledge the slowly refining Islamic law
- 750-833 saw a rise in the Abbasid power

### The Abbasids Decline
- al-Mu'tasim began to introduce foreign (Berber, Slav, and Turkish) which were not originally Muslim (though they "converted")
- This still began to shatter the unity built around a shared religion

### The Abbasids
- Some of the most famous caliphs in history were Abbasids (al-Rashid and al-Ma'mun)
- Later practices that would become mainstream were founded in the Abbasid Dynasty, such as slave armies

### The Golden Age (775-861)
- The golden age was up until 833
- This was when the power was being created and solidified
- The capital moved from Damascus to Baghdad
- This was done to be closer to Persia where the Mawali supporter base was located (those who helped overthrow the Umayyads)
- Baghdad was centrally located between Europe and Asia and was important for trade
- Scholars living in Baghdad translated Greek texts and made scientific discoveries
- This is the period when most of our current Islamic religious writings were originally penned
- This is when the Hadith, Sira, and Maghazi were written
- Christians and Jews actually helped with the great translations from Greek to Arabic
- Baghdad was a center for thinkers and philosophers
- in 756, Al-Mansur sent some 4,000 Arab mercenaries to assist the Chinese Tang dynasty in the An Shi Rebellion against An Lushan
- The Abbasides or "Black Flags" are noted in the Tang dynasty chronicles as the black robed Tazi (a persion term for Arab)
- The Abbasids are usually connected with black flags while Shiites are connected with green flags
- Al-Rashid sent embassies to China to help in war. They had a good relation with them.


## Lecture 31

### Abbasid Caliphs
- Taking a quick look at the early years of the Abbasid caliphate
- This would be seen as "the golden age"

#### Al-Mansur
- Regnal Name = Made victorious by Allah
- born as Abu Ja'far 'Abd Allah ibn Muhammad
- All of these caliphs gave themselves regal names, to show themselves as divinely purposed to lead the Umma (Muslim community)
- Born in Humaymah (today Jordan) in 709 and died during the hajj in Mecca 775
- - Most important city of the Umayyads is Damascus
- - Most important cities to the Shiites is Karbala and Kufa (more Kufa)
- - Most important city for the Abbasids is Humaymah (where the Abbasid revolution started), though Baghdad is also important
- Brother of al-Saffah
- The second caliph of the Abbasid dynasty but often identified as the "real founder of the Abbasid dynasty"
- Established the capital city of Baghdad
- Umayyads killed al-Mansur's brother after being arrested at the end of their dynasty
- He wiped out the last bits of Umayyad resistance
- His main helper was Abu Muslim
- Ultimately though, al-Mansur would kill Abu Muslim to consolidate power and remove a potential rival
- He also put down the people of Khorasan and applied harsh treatment of the 'Alids
- These were seen as "extremist supporters" of the Abbasids, and were gotten rid of to disassociate with them

#### Al-Mahdi
- The third Abbasid Caliph
- reigned 775 to 785 (when he died)
- His wife, the First Lady, al-Khayzuran was a former slave firl from Yemen and a woman of strong personality who greatly influenced political and social affairs of her husband
- - She was his concubine (his favorite) and when he became Caliph she was freed and married him, against his first wife, the daughter of Caliph al-Saffah
- - She also talked talked al-Mahdi out of letting his first wife's son from being the next Caliph
- - When Mahdi died, Al-Hadi, Khayzuran's son became Caliph
- - She was an ally of the Barmakids

#### The Barmakids (Al-barmaika)
- A priestly family of Iranian origin from Khorasan
- Served as scribes and viziers to early Abbasid caliphs
- their ancestor was a barmuk, a title borne by the high priest in the Buddhist temple
- Very fond and supportive of literature, philosophy, and science
- tolerant of various religious and philosophical issues
- hated the Umayyads because they (Umayyads) conquered the native town of the Barmakids in 663, leading to a hatred towards Arabs
- Their ancestor Khalid ibn Barmak served under al-Saffah for administering taxes
- During the reign of al-Mansur, Khalid was appointed governor of Fars, but was later (in 775) dismissed because of political rivalry and Al-Madhi's wife helped him raise the money to pay his heavy fines
- The Barmakids influence would only last 17 years though, and would be done by Caliph Harun
- They fell because:
- - Too much Influence in the court
- - Enriched themselves (and were overly generous)
- - Were too liberal toward other religious and political sects

#### Al-Hadi
- Reigned for two years (785-786)
- Most importantly, he persecuted the 'Alids and Shiites
- At this point, the religious distinctions of Shiites are beginning to form

#### Harun al-Rashid
- Honorific (regal name) = The one following the right path
- Son of al-Mahdi and al-Khayzuran, grandson of al-Mansur
- Fifth caliph of the Abbasid dynasty
- Ruled Islam at the zenith of its Empire with a luxury in Baghdad that was memorialized in "The Thousand and One Nights" (The Arabian Nights Entertainment)
- - Other stories come from this, like Aladdin and Ali Baba
- - Shahrazad must hold the interest of her despotic husband the sultan with nightly tales, or she will be put to death in the morning
- Because of al-Khayzuran influence, the Barmakids largely controlled the empire until 803
- Harun would be the one to put a stop to the Barmakids control
- Harun's reign was full of internal strife
- - local revolts in Egypt, Syria, and Yemen (among other eastern provinces)
- - Government was usually enough to quell these though
- Harun's wife was also very influencial: Zubaydah
- Zubaydah would only eat with gold/silver vessels studded with gems
- Harun was a connoisseur of music and would give lavish gifts to outstanding musicians and poets
- Harun ended up destroying the Barmakids, the group that mostly gave him all his power via their support
- allegedly, Harun arranged for Ja'far the Barmakid to marry his sister as long as they did not consummate the marriage, but they fell in love, so he had Ja'far executed and his famliy imprisoned
- Arabs and Persians (both Muslim groups) would often fight for power
- Harun did not do a good job of sticking with one side or the other
- the tension between the two grew and grew because Harun did not work to rectify it
- This struggle woudl continue for at least 50 years
- Harun would assign leadership to the East and West to different sons, in order to keep the regions separated because he recognized the problem
- This would become a more obvious problem later


## Lecture 32

### Harun al-Rashid (continued)
- He divided the empire between his two sons
- - one (Al-Amin) was the son of the Arab princess Zubaydah and had an Arab tutor (al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi)
- - the other (Al-Ma'mun) was a son of a Persian slave girl and had a Barmakid protege as a tutor
- After his death, the two sons fought each other
- Most of Harun's fame comes from the wealth and lavishness of his court
- His wealth and lavish lifestyle are the stuff of Arabic legend
- Al-Amin would succeed him as caliph, but his brother al-Ma'mun was not ready to give up power just yet
- So for a time there were "two caliphs"

### Al-Ma'mun
- son of Harun al-Rashid
- The seventh Abbasid caliph
- reigned from 813-833
- died August 833
- Openly fought the scholars (Hadith writers) and imposed Mutazilism (see below)
- - A vision within Islam that seeks to interpret Islam in what makes sense
- - "The point is how to interpret Islam in a way that makes sense"
- - "Is the Qur'an created? Sure? Maybe?"
- - This is over and against the Hadith traditions
- - Much more Greek in its philosophy
- - Ultiamtely more about concentrating his power in religious matters
- Was the son of an Iranian concubine
- Was older than al-Amin
- he recognized his brother as successor to the caliphate in Baghdad, but his brother (al-Amin) acknowledged his brother's almost absolute sovereignty over the easter provinces of the empire from his seat at Merv in Khorasan
- Harun al-Rashid's death in March 809 created discord and armed conflict between the two brothers
- Al-Ma'mun was stripped of his rights by al-Amin to be the next successor, and was thereafter supported by the Persians
- Al-Ma'mun then stormed and destroyed his brother's caliphate, and al-Amin was killed (though supposedly against Al-Ma'mun's orders)
- Attempted to impose Mu'tazili Doctrine
- Decided in 833 to require all his subjects to adhere to Mu'tazilah

#### The Mihna of the Abbasids - The Muslim Inquisition
- Al-Ma'mun likely did not care about the religious differences that much, but would like to be the sole arbiter of religious discourse
- A careful political move then is to impose the views that his opponents cannot agree with (Mu'tazilah) in order to begin fighting them
- SIDE NOTE: It seems odd to believe that the Qur'an is uncreated, because that appears to be a secodn god, which is polytheism
- NOT REALLY A SIDE NOTE: The issue of the Qur'an being uncreated was a key point in the Mu'tazilah debate
- During the second caliph, much of the writings of Muhammad's traditions came into being
- this explains the rise of power of the Ulama (the religious scholars)
- This in turn was a threat to the caliphs' power
- The Mihna showed that the Caliphs were not willing to give power to the scholars, no matter how much they said they are "religious caliphs"
- The inquisition (Mihna) was then used to give a theological test to kill those in opposition to the caliphs
- The person being judged would need to admit that the Qur'an was created at some point and agree with the Mu'tazilah
- Ultimately the Mihna would fail after three caliphates
- this failure would propel the Ulama into more power as it proved that they (not the caliphs) were the principle religious authority in Islam
- Ultimately the Mihna served to simply affirm the religious leadership within the Umma
- This also refelcts the struggle that non-Muslims were entering into when they were being forced to convert to Islam at this time
- The Mihna does have general scholarly concensus around the fact that it reflects a Sunni/Shiite struggle
- - On the one hand Al-Ma'mun was working to reconcile the Shiites to the Abbasids by taking on the title of Imam, and declaring Ali the second-in-rank after Muhammad
- - on the other hand, al-Mutawakkil (who ended the Mihna) appears to have realized the importance of the Ulama and their crucial role in advancing the knowledge of Muhammad's sunna
- - - he would also abandon the Shiite movement and give gifts to the scholars and demand that hadith be recited that condemn the Mutazilite doctrines
- - - he also demolished the shrine of al-Hussayn in Karbala
- We see the Qur'an's createdness is a key point of discussion in the texts from this era
- We also see that Shiite and Sunni fighting influenced the writings from this period greatly (and should be watched for when reading things from this period)
- Post-Mihna would increase persecution on non-Muslims because they became under greater subjection to the Ullama
- The Ulama sought to enforce a strict code of law, unlike the Caliphs
- The culmination of this stricter application of the Islamic laws would reach their peak with the Pact of Umar
- At this point the Ulama were no longer just the authority on religion, but in some cases it appears they became the AUTHORS of religious tenants themselves
