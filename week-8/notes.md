## Lecture 33

### Abbasid Caliphate - Fractures, Divisions, and Autonomous Dynasties (861-945)
- We must remember that every piece of literature written during the Abbasid caliphates were designed to cement their power over their rivals the Umayyads
- The Abbasids faced challenges a little closer to home
- by 820, the Samanids began exercising independant authority in Greater Khurasan
- Also, the Shia Hamdanids in Northern Syria began to be independant
- In Iran, the Tahirid and Saffarid dynasties were declared
- The trend of weakening central power continued for all but the ten-year period of Al-Mu'tadid's rule (ended in 902)
- ^ He brought back parts of Egypt, Syria, and Khurasan
- As early as 793, the Shia dynasty of Irisids set up a state from Fez in Morocco
- by the 870s Egypt became autonomous under Ahmad ibn Tulun, and the Tuluni State lasted for 40 years
- by the early 900s the Abbasids almost lost control of Iraq to various amirs (princes) and the caliph al-Radi was forced to acknowledge their power by creating his position as "prince of princes"
- Caliph al-Mustakfi hada short reign from 944-946
- - During this time, the Buyids (Shia, Arabic Buyhiyya) swept into power and assumed control over the bureaucracy of Baghdad
- - This lasted for nearly 100 years

#### Buyid Dynasty
- Also called Buwayhid (945 - 1055)
- The line was founded by the three sons of Buyeh (or Buwayh)
- by the 920s, North Africa was lost to the Abbasids
- A strong Shia sect (the fivers) took control of Egypt, Syria, and North Africa, calling themselves the Fatimid dynasty
- - They advanced to Egypt in 969, and established their capital near Fustat in Cairo
- - This became a center of Shia learning and politics

#### Fatimid Dynasty
- Lasted from 909 - 1171
- Tried unsuccessfully to oust the Abbasid caliphs as leaders of the Islamic world
- They claimed descent from Fatima, Muhammad's daughter
- By 1000 AD, they had become the chief political and ideological challenge to Sunni Islam

#### Mamluks: an example of a local dynasty (1261-1517)
- in the 9th century the Abbasids created an army of non-Arab slaves, called Mamluks
- This was created during the reign of Al-Ma'mun
- The Mamluk army though often viewed negatively, both helped and hurt the caliphate
- The power of the Mamluks steadily grew
- They eventually came to power in Egypt in 1261
- They reestablished the Abbasid caliphate in Cairo
- the first such caliph was Al-Mustansir
- Most restoration of authority focused mainly on religious matters
- This was when the toughest persecution against Christians in Egypt took place (most of the early years of Islam did not have a lot of persecution for Christians)

#### Mongol Invasion (1206-1258)
- Ansolutely wiped out peoples and places that they conquered
- Seige of Baghdad was led by Hulagu Khan in 1258
- Genghis Khan established a powerful dynasty among the Mongols in central Asia in 1206
- During the 13th century, they would conquer most of the Eurasian land mass including both China in the East and much of the old Islamic caliphate in the West
- Hulagu Khan's destruction of Baghdad in 1258 is often seen as the end of the golden age


## Lecture 34

### Medieval Arabic-Speaking Apologetics: How Christians defended their faith under the Abbasids
- There is a wealth of literature about Christian/Muslim dialog from the Abbasid period
- Mamluk persecution was a problem, but it was not the norm across the entire Muslim empire

#### Islam's origins
- Muhammad died in 632
- Muslim literary sources for his life begin aroudn 750-800
- Mostly wrote under the Abbasid caliphs
- Muslims believe these sources to generally present the true and historical Muhammad
- Very few scholars regard them as straightforward historical accounts though
- The picture presented by these sources are of a divinely guided prophet with a revealed book who launched raids and conquest under Allah's direction
- Non-Muslim sources describe Muhammad in a slightly different light
- Many of his neighbors portrayed him as a false prophet, or a brutal conqueror, etc.
- Robert Hoyland lists the first non-Muslim source that holds the first explicit reference to Muhammad as dated Friday, Feburary 7, 634 and is attributed to Thomas the Presbyter in a description about the Battle of Dathin

#### Theology of Islam
- For Muslims:
- - Muhammad is the example of all conduct
- - The Qur'an is Allah's final and perfect revelation
- Christians must understand their own stance on:
- - Is Muhammad actually a prophet?
- - Is the Qur'an divinely inspired?
- - Much has been written on theological discourses between Islam and Christianity
- - It is difficult, and arguably unbiblical to say that Muhammad is a prophet in a biblical sense, because the Bible explicitly states that anyone who separates Jesus from being God is a false prophet (1 John 4:1-3)
- Sidney H. Griffith argues that in Christian/Muslim debates in the early Islamic period, the Christians were at best willing to list Muhammad as something slightly less than a prophet and the Qur'an as slightly less than a divinely inspiried book

#### The Disputation of Jurji the Monk
- An accoutn of a disputation between a Christian monk and three learned Mohammedans on the subject of religion
- This was a 50-page Arabic text
- It was an account of a Syrian monk from the Monastery of Mar Siman near the city of Antioch
- This account allegedly takes place in 1216 AD
- This likely took place in a caliph's court, where religious men and philosophers would come together and debate topics in the hearing of the caliph
- A small delegation of monks speak with the emir al-Malik al-Zahir ibn Ayyub
- For two days the monk debated several Muslims on matters including:
- - Monastic life
- - Islamic claims
- - curruption of the Gospels
- - Muhammad's prophetic office
- - the Triune nature of God
- - the incarnation
- - discerning true religion
- Jirji covers nearly the entire range of the Christian-Muslim controversy
- these were likely heavily discussed topics
- Did this debate actually happen? Possibly not, since it seems like the Christian monk is entirely better in his arguements than the opponents
- Professor Samir Khalil believes that it did happen because of the details used in it
- perhaps it was revised by later Christians for their own readers

#### Jurji's basics
- Jurji knows the Bible well (so should Christians today)
- For Jurji, the Bible is God's Word, fully truthful, uncorrupt, totally reliable
- Christ is unmatched, his teaching is supreme and divine
- Jurji knows the Qur'an well (Christians should too, if they desire to have good conversations with Muslim neighbors)
- For him the Qur'an is not divine and is only instructive for Muslims (those who believe it)
- Jurji is mindful of the context he is in (a minority Christian, surrounded by mostly educated Muslims)
- Jurji knows the Hadith and the Sira well (as should Christians, if we want to have constructive conversations with Muslims)
- Christians must be able to correct arguements that are not true in either Christianity OR Islam, by looking to both religion's texts
- Jurji knows the Muslim accusations against Christianity well
- Jurji is always respectful, constantly logical, never compromising, and sometimes sarcastic

### The Christian's goal when interacting with Muslims
- Proposing a Christian theology of Muhammad and the Quran based on some lessons from Jurji the Monk
#### Jurji's views on Muhammad
- Before stating what he believes about Muhammad, Jurji explores Muhammad's words on Paradise, lusts, women, fighting, and so forth
- Jurji concludes that we do not call Muhammad a prophet or messenger of God as Christians
- In comparing Muhammad to Jesus, Jurji questions, "how can we equate the servant to the master, the created to the creator, the man to deity?"
- Jurji notes that as Christians, we do not assign Muhammad al-ikram (honor)
- Jurji could have lost his head, but he was respectful and careful to present exactly what Christians truly believe in a faithful manner
- Muhammad, in a Christian view, led pagans away from worshipping idols to something different, but not to the true worship of God because he (Muhammad) wanted to rule over them
- Jurji explains that Muhammad met the monk Bahira who educated him and drew him away from paganism and to not worship the big idol called "al-Akbar"
- Jurji states that Muhammad then, fearful of his people, compromised and said "Worship Allah, and fear al-Akbar"
- ^ Was this true? We don't know, but this is what Jurji was familiar with in his context
- Muhammad wanted to subdue the Arabs and so he invented a paradise that convinced people to join him and then killed those who later rejected him
- Unlike Christ, Muhammad killed those who did not agree with him
- For Jurju, Muhammad was lustful for women, married his son's wife forcefully. this charge is brought up twice
- Jurji questions the plausability of following Muhammad when even Muhammad says in the Qur'an that he and the Muslims are on a dalal (misguidance)
- Muslims in Jurji's time keep repeating in prayer "guide us to the right path" indicating that they are not currently on the right path


## Lecture 35

#### Jurji's views on the Qur'an
- Jurji used mainly Qur'anic texts to disprove them
- Rather than devise shortcomings of Muhammad himself, Jurji used the shortcomings that are admitted in the Muslims' own books
- Jurji calls out that the Qur'an testifies to the correctness of the Christian religion itself
- Jurji used specific Surats
- Jurji pointed out that the Qur'an testifies to the truthfulness of the Bible, so then he argues to read the Bible

#### Jurji's defense of Christianity
- unlike sophisticated contemporary claims, Jurji defends the faith by its uniqueness and reasonability
- He does not pretend Christianity is not a religion
- Refutations:
- - We do not worship a created being, Does God have a Spirit and Word? (yes) Are they eternal or created? (eternal)
- - We do NOT worship the cross
- - - we love the cross because it is where Jesus gave His life for us
- - - we do not believe the cross on its own is of value without Christ and His work
- - The Bible cannot be corrupt
- Technique 1:
- - Telling stories to make a point
- - A master who wanted to save his sick and rebellious servant
- - Using the story to lead the listener to the greatest real world sacrifice: Jesus
- Technique 2:
- - Logical Reasoning!
- - Muslims charge: "You say Jesus is God? Can a god eat, drink, or go the restroom?
- - Jurji responds: why did you not mention the divine miracles he performs? They prove He IS God and therefore that God can do those things
- - Jurji asks, if you Muslims, the angels, and God pray on Muhammad, then who answers the prayer? If you ask don't Christians pray on Jesus? no, we pray TO Him
- - Refute misconceptions and raise good questions
- - When a question is vague, ask "What do you mean by that?" It will help clarify the conversation
- - Define your own beliefs and assertions: "How did you come to this claim?" "What makes you ask that question?"
- Technique 3:
- - Focus on Jesus
- - Wherever your words take you, bring the conversation back to Jesus
- - Jesus makes Christianity the most sensible of the "big four" religions
- - Christianity is exclusive, that is not bad, that is a fact
- - Christians should not be ashamed of Christianity
- - A core comparison: A kind creator does not reveal or make a law of anything that opposes His character
- - The focus: the example of Christ - He did, and then He taught (Jesus always demonstrated first what He would teach)

#### Jurji's Questioning Islam
- Do not be ashamed of assertive questions of Islam
- Things in the West have really become all about "political correctness" but that is not how we should handle conversations about important topics like our religions
- Be willing to compare Christ to Muhammad
- - Did Muhammad raise the dead or kill the living?
- - Did Muhammad keep promises or lie repeatedly?
- - Did Muhammad marry four, nine, or eleven, or live righteously with Zayd's wife?
- - Did Muhammad insult people, like Abu Lahab's wife?
- - Swords in wars? not using Miracles to accomplish his tasks?
- Can Islam be considered universal if Muhammad was sent to only the Arabs and the Qur'an can only be in the Arabic?

#### A Christian Theology of Muhammad and the Qur'an
- Good theology must:
- - Start from the Bible, not social or cultural considerations
- Be Christ-centered and stem from the supremacy of Christ
- Aim to share the Gospel of Hope as foudn in God's redemptive plan
- Other things you can add:
- - Be loving
- - Be respectful
- - Be friendly
- - ^ These are important but they cannot drive theology. They are to be the core of the way we share our message, especially as Christians

#### A few passages from the Bible to clarify Jurji's positions
- Colossians 2:2-4, 8-10
- We must test the spirits. Christians cannot agree that Muhammad is a prophet or that the Qur'an is inspired divinely
- 1 John 4:1-3
- 1 Corinthians 1:18-25
