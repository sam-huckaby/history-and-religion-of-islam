### Abbasid Caliphate - Fractures, Divisions, and Autonomous Dynasties (861-945)
- We must remember that every piece of literature written during the Abbasid caliphates were designed to cement their power over their rivals the Umayyads
- The Abbasids faced challenges a little closer to home
- by 820, the Samanids began exercising independant authority in Greater Khurasan
- Also, the Shia Hamdanids in Northern Syria began to be independant
- In Iran, the Tahirid and Saffarid dynasties were declared
- The trend of weakening central power continued for all but the ten-year period of Al-Mu'tadid's rule (ended in 902)
- ^ He brought back parts of Egypt, Syria, and Khurasan
- As early as 793, the Shia dynasty of Irisids set up a state from Fez in Morocco
- by the 870s Egypt became autonomous under Ahmad ibn Tulun, and the Tuluni State lasted for 40 years
- by the early 900s the Abbasids almost lost control of Iraq to various amirs (princes) and the caliph al-Radi was forced to acknowledge their power by creating his position as "prince of princes"
- Caliph al-Mustakfi hada short reign from 944-946
- - During this time, the Buyids (Shia, Arabic Buyhiyya) swept into power and assumed control over the bureaucracy of Baghdad
- - This lasted for nearly 100 years

#### Buyid Dynasty
- Also called Buwayhid (945 - 1055)
- The line was founded by the three sons of Buyeh (or Buwayh)
- by the 920s, North Africa was lost to the Abbasids
- A strong Shia sect (the fivers) took control of Egypt, Syria, and North Africa, calling themselves the Fatimid dynasty
- - They advanced to Egypt in 969, and established their capital near Fustat in Cairo
- - This became a center of Shia learning and politics

#### Fatimid Dynasty
- Lasted from 909 - 1171
- Tried unsuccessfully to oust the Abbasid caliphs as leaders of the Islamic world
- They claimed descent from Fatima, Muhammad's daughter
- By 1000 AD, they had become the chief political and ideological challenge to Sunni Islam

#### Mamluks: an example of a local dynasty (1261-1517)
- in the 9th century the Abbasids created an army of non-Arab slaves, called Mamluks
- This was created during the reign of Al-Ma'mun
- The Mamluk army though often viewed negatively, both helped and hurt the caliphate
- The power of the Mamluks steadily grew
- They eventually came to power in Egypt in 1261
- They reestablished the Abbasid caliphate in Cairo
- the first such caliph was Al-Mustansir
- Most restoration of authority focused mainly on religious matters
- This was when the toughest persecution against Christians in Egypt took place (most of the early years of Islam did not have a lot of persecution for Christians)

#### Mongol Invasion (1206-1258)
- Ansolutely wiped out peoples and places that they conquered
- Seige of Baghdad was led by Hulagu Khan in 1258
- Genghis Khan established a powerful dynasty among the Mongols in central Asia in 1206
- During the 13th century, they would conquer most of the Eurasian land mass including both China in the East and much of the old Islamic caliphate in the West
- Hulagu Khan's destruction of Baghdad in 1258 is often seen as the end of the golden age
